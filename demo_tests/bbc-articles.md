To quote George RR Martin himself: "Tolkien doesn’t ask the question: ‘What was Aragorn’s tax policy? Did he maintain a standing army? What did he do in times of flood and famine?’” These early scenes are a rare moment of happiness and celebration in a world that seems to abhor both And so, after The Battle of Winterfell, it makes perfect sense that priorities would shift – but not before everyone burnt their dead, and drank in the dizzying high that they had not joined them

* **Density 3** ->  The sixth season of the fantasy drama will finally reveal the fate of fan favourite Jon Snow, played by Kit Harington (Credit: HBO) If it had been turned into a movie in the ‘90s it would have been watered down The book series’ long road to TV stardom seems like a kind of fate that fans should all thank the Seven Gods for: if it had immediately been made into a movie in the ‘90s – the more likely scenario for popular books at the time – it would have been hampered by time constraints and possibly watered down to avoid a restrictive R rating in the US, which would have prevented children under the age of 17 from seeing it without an accompanying adult

* **Density 2** ->  I don't know that anything more clearly illustrates the difference between early TV and what we have now than the journey from Mister Ed to BoJack In the 1960s, television gave us a talking horse in the form of Mister Ed, a show that was basically about how funny it is that a horse can talk and only one dude is aware of it

* **Density 3** -> In recent years, BBC Culture has conducted an annual poll of film critics, experts and industry figures from around the world to decide on the greatest films in a particular category: you may have come across our 100 greatest films directed by women list in 2019 and our 100 greatest non-English language films in 2018, among others

* **Density 3** ->  What was it about Squid Game that shattered mainstream Western hesitancy towards non-English language content in 2021? And what does its popularity mean for film and television in 2022? Is Squid Game a one-off pandemic pop culture anomaly – or the beginning of a new age of non-English language film and TV ascendency around the world? No more cultural gatekeeping When Seattle-based cultural commentator David Chen was growing up, "the only way to watch something like Squid Game would be through very sketchy websites or DVD shops," he laughs   
* **Density 5** ->  Squid Game has achieved global mainstream visibility in a way that arguably no other non-English language film or TV show has ever managed Non-English language movies like Parasite, Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth, French romance Amélie and 2000's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon have all won Western acclaim and awards before (not a marker by which they should be judged: these are all astonishing works of art, with or without Western approval)
