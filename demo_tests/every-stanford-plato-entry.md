*  But how can we explain what this property amounts to and defend our wavering intuitions about which events fall in the category of the ‘active’ and which do not? Donald Davidson [1980, essay 3] asserted that an action, in some basic sense, is something an agent does that was ‘intentional under some description,’ and many other philosophers have agreed with him that there is a conceptual tie between genuine action, on the one hand, and intention, on the other

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/collingwood-aesthetics/

*  And an earlier cluster theorist defines artworks as all and only those things that belong to any instantiation of an artform, offers a list of seven properties all of which together are intended to capture the core of what it is to be an artform, though none is either necessary or sufficient, and then claims that having aesthetic value (of the same sort as mountains, sunsets, mathematical theorems) is “what art is for” (Bond 1975)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dewey-aesthetics/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gadamer-aesthetics/
*  The claim that a work of art “says something to someone” (Palmer 2001, 70) alludes to the surprise, shock and, sometimes, dismay at being directly affected by what is in a work and of being forced to reflect on its claim so that it becomes more understandable to both oneself and others

*  One may be regarded as taking up Aristotle’s idea in the Poetics that “katharsis,” purification or purgation, of the emotions of fear and pity, is a valuable part of our response to a tragedy; this led to an emphasis on the emotional impact of aesthetic experience that was downplayed in the cognitivist tradition

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetics-of-everyday/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger-aesthetics/
* [28] Heidegger expresses this hope that separates him from Hegel in the form of a question: “The truth of Hegel’s judgment has not yet been decided,” he writes, because the question remains: Is art still an essential and a necessary way in which that truth happens which is decisive for our historical existence, or is art this no longer? (PLT 80/GA5 68) Heidegger’s point is that Hegel will no longer be right—the time of great art will no longer be at an end—if contemporary humanity still needs an encounter with art in order to learn how to understand the being of entities in a genuinely post-modern way, and if we still remain capable of such an encounter   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/affirmative-action/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/african-ethics/
*  On the terms ‘Ethics’ and ‘Morality’ The term ‘ethics’ is technically used by philosophers to mean a philosophical study of morality—morality understood as a set of social rules, principles, norms that guide or are intended to guide the conduct of people in a society, and as beliefs about right and wrong conduct as well as good or bad character

*  Global atheists might object that, even if atheism and (metaphysical) naturalism are not identical, a belief in the former can be based on a belief in the latter; in other words, if one has good arguments for the view that nature is a closed system, then that removes any burden to consider each God-concept separately, so long as all legitimate concepts of God imply that God is a supernatural entity—that is, an entity that is not natural, yet affects nature   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weakness-will/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/akan-person/
*  In this respect, one cannot point to such accidental characteristics as height, gender, age, marital status, or social class as basis for personhood: [W]hat a person acquires are status, habits, and personality or character traits: he, qua person acquires and thus becomes the subject of acquisition, and being thus prior to acquisition process, he cannot be defined by what he acquires   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/al-baghdadi/
*  For ‘Abd al-Latif, as for al-Farabi’s Plato, philosophical research begins with an investigation of what constitutes the perfection of man as man, which does not consist of a healthy physique, a pleasant face, noble descent, a large group of friends and lovers; nor does it consist in riches, glory, or power, since none of these is able to make man fully and truly happy   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/al-farabi/
*  Following this traditional theoretical order makes much sense since we know very little about the chronological order of al-Fârâbî’s works, even if there is some indication that The Opinions of the People of the Virtuous City, also known as The Perfect State, and The Political Regime, also known as The Principles of the Beings, may be among his latest works   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/al-farabi-metaphysics/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-aesthetics/
*  This concern is also to be found in On Poets, where Aristotle asks this question: Are we not going to say that even though not in verse, the so-called mimes of Sophron are works in prose and works of representation, and that the same goes for the dialogues of Alexameneus of Teos, which were written before the Socratic dialogues? (Janko 2011, F44a) Since such written dialogues are meant to be a mimesis of dialogues that did, or rather might have taken place, they too must be considered as a kind of poetry (or what we would call literature)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicius/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-categories/
*  What do the categories classify? What theory of predication underlies Aristotle’s scheme? What is the relationship between categorialism and hylemorphism, Aristotle’s other major ontological theory? Where does matter fit, if at all, in the categorial scheme? When did Aristotle write the Categories? Did Aristotle write the Categories? Is the list of kinds in the Categories Aristotle’s considered list, or does he modify his views elsewhere? Is Aristotle’s view of substance in the Categories consistent with his view of substance in the Metaphysics? Is there some method that Aristotle used in order to generate his list of categories? Is Aristotle’s categorialism philosophically defensible in whole or in part? If only in part, which part of categorialism is philosophically defensible? Given the divergence of expert opinion about even the most basic aspects of Aristotle’s Categories, it is inevitable that an attempt to give a neutral account of the basic positions it contains will be seen as wrong-headed, perhaps drastically so, by some scholars or other

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/
*  Works on Rhetoric According to ancient testimonies, Aristotle wrote an early dialogue on rhetoric entitled ‘Grullos’, in which he put forward the argument that rhetoric cannot be an art (technê); and since this is precisely the position of Plato's Gorgias, the lost dialogue Grullos has traditionally been regarded as a sign of Aristotle's (alleged) early Platonism   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/

*  For if there is to be one rule for conceptual art and another for all other kinds of art, are there still good grounds for thinking of conceptual art as a kind of art? Moreover, could not every particular kind of artform or artwork demand a separate theory of art, artist and artistic experience? If we are to sidestep such an intrinsic division between conceptual art on the one hand, and other kinds of art on the other, then theories concerned mainly with art that is not conceptual will have to make many significant concessions in order to incorporate the problematic case that conceptual artworks present   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/erotic-art/
* Erotic Art What is erotic art? Do all paintings with a sexual theme qualify as erotic? How to distinguish between erotica and erotic art? In what way are aesthetic experiences related to, or different from, erotic experiences and are they at all compatible? Both people and works of art can be sensually appealing, but is the beauty in each case substantially the same? How helpful is the distinction between the nude and the naked? Can we draw a strict line between erotic art and pornography? We tend to think of art as complex and of pornography as one-dimensional, but how compelling is that differentiation? Pornography is often considered harmful, objectifying, and exploitative, but to what extent is erotic art immune to moral criticism of this sort? In addressing such questions this entry will provide an overview of current philosophical debates on erotic art

For example, why honor the requirement when a fully capacitated Jehovah’s Witness refuses a blood transfusion on religious grounds? Why honor it when health is not at stake, for example, in experiments on stored tissue? Finally, specifically from a utilitarian standpoint, why honor the requirement on occasions when it seems to set back collective health, for example, when we cannot develop a new drug that would help many, because no one is altruistic enough to consent to participate in its risky study? 2

But do not you your self perceive or think of them all the while? This therefore is nothing to the purpose: it only shows you have the power of imagining or forming ideas in your mind; but it doth not shew that you can conceive it possible, the objects of your thought may exist without the mind: to make out this, it is necessary that you conceive them existing unconceived or unthought of, which is a manifest repugnancy

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/molecular-biology/
*  Given the general importance of mechanisms and the fact that mechanisms play such a central role in the field of molecular biology, it is not surprising that philosophers of biology pioneered analyzing the concept of mechanism (see the entry on mechanisms in science)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/biomedicine/
*  The biomedical model is in fact so commonplace that it is easy to overlook how philosophically weighty (and contentious) its core commitments are: that health phenomena must be understood in terms of physical/biochemical entities and processes, that experimental techniques are the preferred means of acquiring and assessing health-related knowledge, and that human bodies are best understood as composed of a collection of subsidiary parts and processes (Krieger 2011: 130)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/boethius/

What makes a classification a good one? What does it mean to track more or less “natural” distinctions in the context of disease? Is such talk of the “naturalness” of disease categories simply confused? The problem of cancer classification is complicated by the fact that cancer progression is a process with a complex natural history

*  While this tradition is perhaps not as dominant today than it once was, there continues to be a lively and active philosophical debate on whether causal notions can play a legitimate role in physics and, if yes, what role that might be   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/category-mistakes/
*  Whether or not these sentences exhibit the kind of infelicity associated with category mistakes depends on context: (11) and (12) are perfectly felicitous in a context where it is clear that the thing I am thinking about/referring to is a pen, but not so in a context where it is the number two   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-medieval/
* 1 Motion in General There is a large body of medieval literature which deals with general change of state: it is important because it led to a great deal of careful analysis of continuous change (under the heading of “intension and remission of forms”), and this body of analysis was one of the contributing currents which led to the invention of the calculus in the sixteenth century

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-law/
*  Second, in the symmetrical overdetermination variety of concurrent cause cases (where two or more factors are individually sufficient and only jointly necessary for some harm), there is universally liability where the acts of each of two or more culpable defendants is independently sufficient (and thus not individually necessary) for the harm, and there is almost always liability where the sufficient condition alternative to the defendant’s action is not the act of another human agent but is a natural event or condition such as an avalanche   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-mani/
*  Then for an event or process \(M\) to qualify as a manipulation of \(X\), it would appear that there must be a causal connection between \(M\) and \(X\): to manipulate \(X\), one must cause it to change in value   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-metaphysics/
*  As to category, the dispute presupposes that there is a unique category of entity from which all causal relata must be drawn   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-causation/
*  So is it in fact the case that working scientists, and in particular, psychologists, find it necessary to appeal to distinctively mental phenomena to account for behavior? Is there evidence in neuroscience that mental states and processes figure in the production of actions? Although most psychologists would without hesitation accept the causal interaction of minds and bodies, a small but growing number of empirical researchers have insisted that the evidence supports some version of epiphenomenalism, the thesis that mental states, while caused by physical happenings, exert no efficacy in return   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-probabilistic/
*  The central idea behind probabilistic theories of causation is that causes change the probability of their effects; an effect may still occur in the absence of a cause or fail to occur in its presence   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-retrocausality/
*  Thus, given Costa de Beauregard’s suggestion of “zigzag” causal influences, it is perfectly possible for a retrocausal model of quantum phenomena to be nonlocal in the sense that causal relations exist between spacelike separated events, but “local” in the sense that these causal influences are mediated by timelike trajectories   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/certainty/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-regularity/
*  A Humean Regularity Theory (HRT), which may or may not coincide with Hume’s genuine analysis of causation, can be summarized as follows: where \(c\) and \(e\) denote token events of the types \(C\) and \(E\), respectively, \(c\) is a cause of \(e\) iff - (i) - \(c\) is spatiotemporally contiguous to \(e\), - (ii) - \(c\) precedes \(e\) in time, and - (iii) - all events of type \(C\) are followed by an event of type \(E\)

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/confucius/
*  By the Han (202 BCE–220 CE), Confucius was already an authoritative figure in a number of different cultural domains, and the early commentaries show that reading texts associated with him about history, ritual, and proper behavior was important to rulers   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comparphil-chiwes/
*  If there is a contrast between the ancient Chinese tradition as represented by the Analects and modern Western traditions, it may be more a matter of the latter being especially focused on matters of distribution of goods by institutions, rather than that interest being entirely absent in the Confucian tradition   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-chinese/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/buddhism-huayan/
*  However, Huayan is a distinctively Chinese form of Buddhism, particularly for the way that it interprets “emptiness” in terms of “interdependence” and treats the natural world as possessing intrinsic value   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/han-dynasty/
*  While prior to the Han, we find a variety of philosophical “schools” associated with different states and individuals (as there was no imperial structure), many (but not all) of the surviving philosophical texts from the Han are associated in some way with the Han state   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-epistemology/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-logic-language/
*  Early Chinese thought does not provide an explicit distinction between fact and value, so it is a matter of controversy to determine which has epistemic priority in Mohist thought—the normative standards by which the correct uses of language guide behavior, or the evaluations of reason that are determined by our ability to ascertain real similarities and differences in perception and thought   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/laozi/
*  The reception of the Laozi in modern Asia and the West falls outside the scope of this article; nevertheless, it is important to note that the Laozi should be regarded not only as a work of early Chinese philosophy, but also in a larger context as a classic of world literature with keen contemporary relevance

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qing-philosophy/
*  While Neo-Confucianism was not a monolith to be sure, to the extent that it argued robustly on behalf of individual moral introspection via one’s nature (xing) and mind-heart (xin) as the realization of ultimate metaphysical truths—variously construed as heaven (tian), principle (li), the great ultimate (taiji), and the Way (dao)—it represented the foremost unfolding and predictive reality-principle that was Song-Ming thought in its totality

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-social-political/
*  To what degree should we rely on institutions (and of what kinds?), and to what degree is human leadership crucial? What sorts of roles, relationships, or hierarchies should structure our societies, and how are they justified? Can they be challenged or changed? Insofar as society is divided into rulers and ruled, what are the responsibilities that each owes to the other, and why? We will see that social and political topics routinely connect up with other aspects of Chinese philosophy—for example, answers to some of the questions just raised lead to further ethical, epistemic, or metaphysical questions—but for the most part it is still possible to make sense of social and political thought in its own terms   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/xunzi/
*  Famously, Mencius argued that the xing of human beings is good (shan 善), by which he meant that all human beings have the capacity to become good, even though, in reality, not all people are good, because they fail to exert themselves sufficiently—or even take the obligation seriously   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/song-ming-confucianism/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-climate/
*  If, for example, one thinks that individuals have human rights to meet their socio-economic needs then this should surely also bear on questions of climate justice too since it provides a reason to combat climate change and a reason to distribute responsibilities so that they do not burden the poor and vulnerable

* 1 Languages The principle of compositionality is normally taken to quantify over expressions of some particular language L: - (C′) - For every complex expression e in L, the meaning of e in L is determined by the structure of e in L and the meanings of the constituents of e in L   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computability/
*  Surprisingly, all of these models are exactly equivalent: anything computable in the lambda calculus is computable by a Turing machine and similarly for any other pairs of the above computational systems   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computing-history/
*  Flowers did not investigate the idea of using electronic equipment for numerical calculation, but has remarked that at the outbreak of war with Germany in 1939 he was possibly the only person in Britain who realized that vacuum tubes could be used on a large scale for high-speed digital computation   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computing-responsibility/
*  The growing pervasiveness of computer technologies in everyday life, the growing complexities of these technologies and the new possibilities that they provide raise new kinds of questions: who is responsible for the information published on the Internet? Who is responsible when a self-driving vehicle causes an accident? Who is accountable when electronic records are lost or when they contain errors? To what extent and for what period of time are developers of computer technologies accountable for untoward consequences of their products? And as computer technologies become more complex and behave increasingly autonomous can or should humans still be held responsible for the behavior of these technologies? This entry will first look at the challenges that computing poses to conventional notions of moral responsibility   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/condemnation/
*  If Tempier, indeed, acted on a papal mandate, it is surprising that he does not mention it in the introduction to his syllabus of errors, but merely indicates that he had received information from important people (Who these “important people” may have been is a question that will be addressed below)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/
*  The title of what Comte always regarded as his seminal work (written in 1822 when he was only 24 years old) leaves no doubt as to the bond between science and politics: it is Plan for the Scientific Work Necessary to Reorganize Society, also called First System of Positive Polity   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/
*  But given that the relation in question is a matter of having a representation with a particular type of functional role, it is simpler to say that occurrent beliefs just are mental representations with this functional role   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computation-physicalsystems/
*  As a reminder, the simple mapping account has it that, for any computational state transition of the form s1 → s2, if the system is in the physical state p1 that maps onto s1, it then goes into the physical state p2 that maps onto s2   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/condillac/
*  He asked his readers to consider an originally inanimate and insentient human being (Condillac spoke of a being that is just a “statue” of a human being) and to consider what this being could come to know were it to acquire each of the senses in isolation from the others, or each in combination with just one or two others   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/
*  Advances in computing raise the prospect that the mind itself is a computational system—a position known as the computational theory of mind (CTM)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computer-science/
*  Turner (2011) is careful to notice that such a definition of specifications is an idealization: specifications are themselves revised in some cases, such as when the specified computational systems cannot be realized because of physical laws constraints or cost limitations, or when it turns out that the advanced specifications are not correct formalizations of the intentions of clients and users   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-philosophy/
*  Anticipations in Leibniz The only way to rectify our reasonings is to make them as tangible as those of the Mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate, without further ado, to see who is right   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/histfem-condorcet/
*  Appreciating the risks he faced in rebutting one of the age’s most deeply held prejudices, he begged for the opportunity to engage in reasoned dialogue with his opponents: I hope that anyone who attacks my arguments will do so without using ridicule or declamation, and above all, that someone will show me a natural difference between men and women on which the exclusion could legitimately be based

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/korean-confucianism/
*  Principle was considered to be an original ideal governing source of all principles of reality in the world, where everything has its own individual principle that is a part of this greater immaterial and universally organising Principle   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/confucius/
*  By the Han (202 BCE–220 CE), Confucius was already an authoritative figure in a number of different cultural domains, and the early commentaries show that reading texts associated with him about history, ritual, and proper behavior was important to rulers   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/confirmation/
*  The basic version (sometimes labelled “naïve”) of the HD notion of confirmation can be spelled out thus: For any \(h, e, k \in \bL\) such that \(h\wedge k\) is consistent: - \(e\) HD-confirms \(h\) relative to \(k\) if and only if \(h\wedge k \vDash e\) and \(k \not\vDash e\); - \(e\) HD-disconfirms \(h\) relative to \(k\) if and only if \(h\wedge k \vDash \neg e\), and \(k \not\vDash \neg e\); - \(e\) is HD-neutral for hypothesis \(h\) relative to \(k\) otherwise   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wang-yangming/
*  Wang continued the serious study of Zhu Xi’s interpretation of Confucianism, but was disillusioned by an experience in which he and a friend made a determined effort to apply what they took to be Zhu Xi’s method for achieving sagehood: …my friend Qian and I discussed the idea that to become a sage or a worthy one must investigate all the things in the world   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/xunzi/
*  Famously, Mencius argued that the xing of human beings is good (shan 善), by which he meant that all human beings have the capacity to become good, even though, in reality, not all people are good, because they fail to exert themselves sufficiently—or even take the obligation seriously   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-conditionals/
*  We go on to examine theories of conditionals involving belief revision, and highlight recent approaches based on the idea that a conditional is assertable provided the truth of its antecedent makes a relevant difference to that of its consequent   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/song-ming-confucianism/
*  The Cheng brothers were most influential of this group, having explicated the metaphysics and techniques of mental discipline that they took to be implicit in Confucian texts and thereby positioning Confucianism as a direct and more formidable rival to Buddhism   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-linguistics/
*  A problem that arises is how the properties of an entity that are active at a given point in time can be properly tied to that entity, and not to other activated entities   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zhu-xi/
* [1] Over time, Zhu Xi’s Neo-Confucian synthesis proved to be a potent philosophic catalyst for his intellectual supporters and opponents alike, until the fall of Imperial China in 1911 and beyond   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conscience-medieval/
*  Since the first three parts of the soul are potentialities and synderesis is classified alongside these, it seems to follow that it too must be a faculty or power of the soul, distinct from the faculty of reason   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conscience/
*  Unfortunately, debates in which appeals to conscience are often made—for example the debate about conscientious objection in health care—are often characterized by a lack of clarity as to what it exactly is that we are talking about when we talk about conscience, and therefore about what exactly people are claiming when they put forward a “conscientious objection” to, for example, abortion   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-higher/
*  So a phenomenally-conscious percept of red, for example, consists in a state with the analog content red which is tokened in such a way as to feed into thoughts about red, or into actions that are in one way or another guided by redness   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/connectionism/

*  (Though it is not quite as clear that when we speak of what one perceives, this is to be understood in just the same way   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/
*  This general approach can be applied at different levels to different normative properties of different kinds of things, but the most prominent example is probably consequentialism about the moral rightness of acts, which holds that whether an act is morally right depends only on the consequences of that act or of something related to that act, such as the motive behind the act or a general rule requiring acts of the same kind   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-17th/
*  How does Descartes respond? As to the fact that there can be nothing in the mind, in so far as it is a thinking thing, of which it is not aware [conscius], this seems to me to be self-evident   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/political-obligation/
*  How does one acquire such an obligation, and how many people have really done what is necessary to acquire it? Or is a political obligation more a matter of being than of doing – that is, of simply being a member of the country or state in question? To those questions many answers have been given, and none now commands widespread assent   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-animal/
*  The remainder of this article deals primarily with the attribution of consciousness in its phenomenal sense to animals, although there will be some discussion of access consciousness, self-consciousness and theory of mind in animals, especially where these have been related theoretically to phenomenal consciousness — as, for instance, in Carruthers' (1998a,b, 2000) argument that a particular sort of mental self-representation is required for phenomenal consciousness   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/
*  Consciousness in both those senses links up as well with Thomas Nagel's (1974) notion of a conscious creature, insofar as one might count a mental state as conscious in the “what it is like” sense just if there is something that it is like to be in that state   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-representational/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequence-medieval/
* 3) In more mundane terms, the two core aspects that Tarski attributes to the so-called common notion of logical consequence can be formulated as: - (TP) - necessary truth-preservation: it is impossible for the antecedent to be true while the consequent is not true; - (ST) - substitution of terms: the relation of consequence is preserved under any (suitable) substitution of the non-logical terms of the sentences in question; this is now often referred to as the formality criterion   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/constructive-empiricism/
*  Van Fraassen defines the view as follows: Science aims to give us theories which are empirically adequate; and acceptance of a theory involves as belief only that it is empirically adequate   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/continental-rationalism/
*  Or, to put it in terms that reflect rationalist thinking on a number of issues, there is only a distinction of reason between the two orders   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism-rule/
*  In that case, we could hold: Actualist rule-consequentialist criterion of wrongness: An act is wrong if and only if it is forbidden by rules the acceptance of which would actually result in the greatest good   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/constitutionalism/
* [4] Though at one time this feature of Austin’s theory had some surface plausibility when applied to the British system of government, where Parliament was often said to be supreme and constitutionally unlimited,[5] it faces obvious difficulty when applied to most other constitutional democracies such as one finds in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Germany, where it is abundantly clear that the powers of government are legally limited by a constitution   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractarianism/
*  This is especially a problem for women, as Dimock points out, since in most cultures women are trained from childhood by sexist norms and gender roles to prefer the well-being of others to their own   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conservation-biology/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/constructivism-metaethics/
* Constructivism in Metaethics Metaethical constructivism is the view that insofar as there are normative truths, they are not fixed by normative facts that are independent of what rational agents would agree to under some specified conditions of choice   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cordemoy/

* 1) conscious of oneself not just as subject but, in Kant’s words (A350), as the ‘single common subject’ of many or all the aspects of the unified experience that one is now having and of a number of similar experiences past and, in anticipation, still to come   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/copernicus/
*  At the time Copernicus’s heliocentric idea was very controversial; nevertheless, it was the start of a change in the way the world was viewed, and Copernicus came to be seen as the initiator of the Scientific Revolution   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contract-law/
*  Still, since many exchange-regimes share basic features, it is not an unreasonable expectation that the principles extracted from a sophisticated and well-functioning body of contract law might aid in our understanding of contract law as such, at least where the law functions to regulate economic life in modern market orders   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contradiction/
*  While Sophists and “even many physicists” may claim that it is possible for the same thing to be and not to be at the same time and in the same respect, such a position self-destructs “if only our opponent says something”, since as soon as he opens his mouth to make an assertion, any assertion, he must accept LNC   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-neuroscience/
*  Thus: Generic Consciousness: What conditions/states N of nervous systems are necessary and (or) sufficient for a mental state, M, to be conscious as opposed to not? If there is such an N, then the presence of N entails that an associated mental state M is conscious and (or) its absence entails that M is unconscious

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contextualism-epistemology/
*  But, insofar as there is some interesting variation in the set of relevant alternatives to a given proposition, we have the possibility of there being a corresponding variation in what it takes to know that p, and so a kind of pluralism here as well   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anna-julia-cooper/
*  This work by Cooper is quite significant insofar as the Haitian Revolution is too often overlooked in relation to the American and French Revolutions, and furthermore, there was a United States military occupation of Haiti at the time she wrote it (1914–1935)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractualism/
*  The wrongness of an action is not to be equated with the properties that make it unjustifiable   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/connectives-logic/
*  Thus to extend the present approach, known as natural deduction, from ∧ to these and other connectives, it is necessary to keep track not only of what formulas we are dealing with at a given stage but also of the set of initial formulas, or assumptions, on which that formula depends   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmopolitanism/
*  The nebulous core shared by all cosmopolitan views is the idea that all human beings, regardless of their political affiliation, are (or can and should be) citizens in a single community   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmology-theology/
*  Creation and the big bang Einstein’s general theory of relativity shows that the structure of spacetime is itself a dynamical variable, subject to causal influence by the material constituents of the universe   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/continuity/
*  It is this definition of continuity that figures in Aristotle's demonstration of what has come to be known as the isomorphism thesis, which asserts that either magnitude, time and motion are all continuous, or they are all discrete   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/crathorn/
*  Since concepts can only belong to the category of quality according to Crathorn, they must be mental qualities having the same nature as non-mental qualities and they must exist subjectively in the mind, which is to say that they exist in some part of the brain (Pasnau 1997)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/corruption/
*  But when a bettor bribes a boxer to “throw” a fight this is corruption for private gain, but it need not involve any public office holder; the roles of boxer and bettor are usually not public offices   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conservatism/
*  Many treat it as a standpoint that is sceptical of abstract reasoning in politics, and that appeals instead to living tradition, allowing for the possibility of limited political reform   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmology-30s/
*  Part of the controversy may be laid to the fact that cosmology was a new science, and disputes about methodology in new sciences are not rare in the history of the sciences   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-temporal/
*  He came to view this is as mistake, and in later writings he argued that the difference between the content of a proteraesthesis and an ordinary (present) sensation lies not in the nature of the object of which we are aware, but rather the way in which we are aware of it – there are ‘temporal modes of consciousness’   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/creation-conservation/
*  Yet another thesis is occasionalism, which says that God is not only the sole cause of the ongoing existence of created things but also of every other event that they may be involved in, including those in which created things may appear to affect others   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/counterfactuals/
*  This might even be used as part of a pragmatic argument for believing in free will: roughly, belief in free will is so practically important, and our knowledge of the world so incomplete, that it is rational to believe that it exists   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmological-argument/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/crescas/
*  The reason for this contradiction is probably that the aim of Crescas in his polemic works is to convince Jews not to convert to Christianity, and Jewish apostates to return to Judaism   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/criminal-law/
*  If this is right, the distinctiveness of criminal law turns out not to consist in the fact that it provides for punishment   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/croce-aesthetics/
*  Second, Croce’s manner of presentation in his famous early works now seems, not to put too fine a point on it, dismissively dogmatic; it is full of the youthful conviction and fury that seldom wears well   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cambridge-platonists/
*  Like the other Cambridge Platonists Culverwell emphasises the freedom of the will and proposes an innatist epistemology, according to which the mind is furnished with ‘clear and indelible Principles’ and reason an ‘intellectual lamp’ placed in the soul by God to enable it to understand God’s will promulgated in the law of nature

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/critical-theory/
*  The positive goal of such a theory is not only to provide an account of rationality based on this know-how that is rich enough to grasp uses of reason in all their variety, yet also normative enough to be able to clarify the necessary conditions for its practical employment as well as a critical analysis of the “pathologies” that occur when these conditions fail to obtain   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evolution-cultural/
*  Cultural evolutionary theory in general requires only a systematic effort to model the effects of cultural inheritance, and one might decide that thinking in terms of natural selection acting on units of culture is not the best way of doing this   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/critical-thinking/
*  Examples and Non-Examples Before considering the definition of critical thinking, it will be helpful to have in mind some examples of critical thinking, as well as some examples of kinds of thinking that would apparently not count as critical thinking

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-cultural-heritage/
* The Ethics of Cultural Heritage Do members of cultural groups have special claims to own or control the products of the cultures to which they belong? Is there something morally wrong with employing artistic styles that are distinctive of a culture to which you do not belong? What is the relationship between cultural heritage and group identity? Is there a coherent and morally acceptable sense of cultural group membership in the first place? Is there a universal human heritage to which everyone has a claim? Questions such as these concern the ethics of cultural heritage (or heritage ethics, for short)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/culture/
*  The essentialist objection targets what it sees as an assumption that members of a culture will hold the same set of practices, norms, and values to be important, and in the same measure

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/laozi/
*  The reception of the Laozi in modern Asia and the West falls outside the scope of this article; nevertheless, it is important to note that the Laozi should be regarded not only as a work of early Chinese philosophy, but also in a larger context as a classic of world literature with keen contemporary relevance   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/neo-daoism/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/daoism-religion/
*  Early Daoist Texts It would hardly be possible to identify a school or a lineage in the history of Daoism which denies that the entire Daoist tradition, in the forms in which it has been transmitted for about two and a half millennia, ultimately derives from Laozi and from the work that is ascribed to him, the Daode jing or Book of the Way and Its Virtue

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/beauvoir/
*  Though readers of the English translation of The Second Sex have never had trouble understanding the feminist significance of its analysis of patriarchy, they might be forgiven for missing its philosophical importance so long as they had to rely on an arbitrarily abridged version of The Second Sex that was questionably translated by a zoologist who was deaf to the philosophical meanings and nuances of Beauvoir’s French terms   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-deception/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-causal/
*  Causal decision theory may also explain that it advances a claim about the evaluation of an act given the agent’s circumstances in Newcomb’s problem   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-theory-descriptive/
*  The agent’s choice dispositions at a given point in time are taken to be determined by his or her preferences, in such a way that, from any set of particular acts, the agent is liable to choose all and only those acts to which no other act is strictly preferred   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/defaults-semantics-pragmatics/
*  Next, some, following Grice, consider such pragmatic contributions to utterance meaning to be generalized conversational implicatures (Levinson), others classify them as pragmatic input to what is said, albeit using a variety of theory-specific labels (Recanati, Carston), reserving the term ‘implicature’ for meanings that can be represented by a separate logical form and that function independently from the content of the main utterance in reasoning   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/definitions/
*  Then, it can be shown that if \(\mathcal{D}\) meets the criteria of Conservativeness and Eliminability then \(\mathcal{D}\) is equivalent to a definition in normal form as specified below   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dedekind-foundations/
*  This is especially so with respect to methodological and epistemological aspects of Dedekind’s approach, which ground the logical and metaphysical views that emerge in his writings   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationality-normative-utility/
*  The expected utility of an act is a weighted average of the utilities of each of its possible outcomes, where the utility of an outcome measures the extent to which that outcome is preferred, or preferable, to the alternatives   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/delmedigo/
*  Be it as it may, it was following his return to Crete and during the last years of his life that Del Medigo composed what would become his most famous work, Beḥinat ha-Dat, which will be discussed in detail below   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-theory/
*  Savage also requires that the desirability of an outcome be independent of the state in which it occurs, as this is necessary for it to be possible to determine a comparative belief relation from an agent’s preferences   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/
*  Where Kant’s question had been “How can the given be given to a subject?” Hume’s question had been “How is the subject (human nature) constituted within the given?” In his mature work, Deleuze argues for an “impersonal and pre-individual” transcendental field in which the subject as identity pole which produces empirical identities by active synthesis is itself the result or product of differential passive syntheses (for instance, in what Deleuze calls the syntheses of habit, we find bodily, desiring, and unconscious “contractions” which unify a series of experiences, extracting that which it to be retained in the habit and allowing the rest to be “forgotten”)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/

*  They can take on an infinite variety of shapes: there are reports of an argument that there is ‘no more’ reason for the atoms to be one shape than another   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/demonstration-medieval/
*  These last two requirements were variously interpreted by medieval thinkers, but we can note that Aristotle allows a statement can be per se in two ways: (1) if its subject term somehow includes its predicate within its definition, so that “A human being is rational” is per se, and (2) if its predicate term includes its subject implicitly in its definition as the proper subject for that sort of accident, so that “A human being is able to laugh” is per se (PA I 4, 73a35-b24   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democracy/
*  First, democracy concerns collective decision making, by which we mean decisions that are made for groups and are meant to be binding on all the members of the group   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-logic/
*  This is very much in the spirit of modern logical theory: all that it takes to show that a certain form is invalid is a single instance of that form with true premises and a false conclusion   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reference/
*  How, for example, does linguistic reference relate to the act of referring—something that we as speakers do with referential terms? How exactly do referential terms come to refer? That is, in virtue of what do they refer to what they do? Is there a single answer to this question, a single mechanism of reference, or different answers depending on the sort of term in question? And what what exactly is the relationship between reference and meaning? Answers to these various questions will turn out to be closely related; the task of this entry will be to trace out some of the main clusters of answers   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/indexicals/
*  For example, Kaplan says that the reference and content of ‘that’ in a context is determined (in part) by the speaker’s pointing gestures or by the speaker’s intention to refer to a particular object   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/
*  Likewise, an agent-relative permission is a permission for some agent to do some act even though others may not be permitted to aid that agent in the doing of his permitted action   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dependence-ontological/
*  For example, when it is said that a particular event, such as the assassination of Caesar, depends for its existence upon Caesar, (EDR) seems to explicate this appropriately in terms of the fact that the assassination could not have existed if Caesar had not existed to be assassinated   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/derrida/
* ” He says, “Will this be possible for us? Will we one day be able to, and in a single gesture, to join the thinking of the event to the thinking of the machine? Will we be able to think, what is called thinking, at one and the same time, both what is happening (we call that an event) and the calculable programming of an automatic repetition (we call that a machine)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/depiction/
*  In fact, this objection only applies to a theory which implies that a spectator perceives a certain kind of object in a picture by perceiving a resemblance between the marks on its surface and an object of this kind, and a resemblance theory need not have this implication   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ethics/
*  The Place of Ethics in Descartes’ Philosophy Descartes did not write extensively on ethics, and this has led some to assume that the topic lacks a place within his philosophy   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/
*  It is likely that he then moved to the house of his great uncle, Michel Ferrand, who, like many of René's male relatives, was a lawyer, and who was Counselor to the King in Châtellerault   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-works/
*  It is also during his stay in Deventer that Descartes probably worked on a final draft of the Traite de l’homme (Treatise on Man), which in connection to the Optics and the Meteorology was probably originally intended to be a part of The World   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-epistemology/
*  The fourth paragraph offers this: But what about when I was considering something very simple and straightforward in arithmetic or geometry, for example that two and three added together make five, and so on? Did I not see at least these things clearly enough to affirm their truth? … when I turn to the things themselves which I think I perceive very clearly, I am so convinced by them that I spontaneously declare: let whoever can do so deceive me, he will never bring it about that I am nothing, so long as I continue to think I am something … or bring it about that two and three added together are more or less than five, or anything of this kind in which I see a manifest contradiction   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-mathematics/
*  That is to say, in analysis we assume what is sought as if it has been achieved, and look for the thing from which it follows, and again what comes before that, until by regressing in this way we come upon some one of the things that are already known, or that occupy the rank of a first principle   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ontological/
*  So, likewise, we are able to attain knowledge of God’s existence simply by apprehending that necessary existence is included in the clear and distinct idea of a supremely perfect being   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-modal/
*  Most of us are inclined to affirm that what we know best we know through the senses, along with the other falsities already mentioned, but in addition: our conceptions of mind and God represent mind and God as sensible when they are not; we think and speak by way of terms that we do not understand or that may have no corresponding idea; and what we take to be the paradigm of a distinct perception is hardly distinct at all   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-physics/
*  Descartes’ actual concept of “space” can be regarded as a sort of conceptual abstraction from this bodily spatial extension, which he also dubs “internal place”: We attribute a generic unity to the extension of the space [of a body], so that when the body which fills the space has been changed, the extension of the space itself is not considered to have been changed or transported but to remain one and the same; as long as it remains of the same size and shape and maintains the same situation among certain external bodies by means of which we specify that space   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-method/
*  (AT 10: 369, CSM 1: 14–15) Descartes provides two useful examples of deduction in Rule 12, where he writes that “when we deduce that nothing which lacks extension can have a shape”, we intuit that the conjunction of the one with the other is wholly necessary […] on the grounds that there is a necessary connection between shape and extension   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pineal-gland/
* Descartes and the Pineal Gland The pineal gland is a tiny organ in the center of the brain that played an important role in Descartes’ philosophy   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotions-17th18th/
*  Bernard Mandeville, for instance, spoke of humans as “a compound of passions” in his Fable of the Bees (1714), emphasizing that our emotions are disorganized, fleeting and not subject to correction   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas/
*  (AT VII 36–7; CSM II 25–6) In this passage, ideas are cast as modes of thinking that represent (or present or exhibit) objects to the mind—objects such as a man, or Pegasus, or the sky, or an angel, or God (and given what Descartes says in the First Meditation, among the list of things exhibited to the mind by way of its ideas, one could add colors, sounds, feels, and so on (AT VII 20; CSM II 13–14))   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descriptions/
*  The problem is that we can be in error as to whether we are directly acquainted with someone (did I really have lunch with a colleague or was that a clever hologram?) and this concern (coupled with the Cartesianism that Russell held at that point in his career) propelled Russell to radically minimize the class of cases where we have acquaintance—down to what he called “egocentric particulars,” which is basically to say I’m only acquainted with myself and sense data   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/desert/
*  We can state this idea a bit more clearly: AID: The claim that a person, S, deserves something, D, on the basis of the fact that he has a feature, DB, is justifiable if and only if there is some social institution, I; I exists in S’s society; S is governed by I; according to the rules of I, those who have DB are to receive D; S has DB   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/desgabets/
*  The union of the mind and body in man is so strict that it founds a species of communication for their commerce, in virtue of which our thoughts are said to have duration, succession, etc   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/teleological-arguments/
*  Furthermore, we could not ground any induction concerning the cosmos itself upon a requisite fund of experiences of other cosmoi found to be both deliberately designed and very like ours in relevant respects—for the simple reason that this universe is our only sample   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/desire/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-ancient/
*  The Stoics, on the other hand, affirm that every single event is causally determined by God in accordance with his providential plan, and they try to show how what we do is under our control in such a world   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/
*  In order to get started we can begin with a loose and (nearly) all-encompassing definition as follows: Determinism: The world is governed by (or is under the sway of) determinism if and only if, given a specified way things are at a time t, the way things go thereafter is fixed as a matter of natural law   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinate-determinables/
*  Supporting this latter contrast is that our thoughts about determinables do not appear to be about (potentially infinite) disjunctions of determinates, and our perceptions of properties such as color and shape do not appear to be of maximal determinates, as would be the case if determinables were disjunctions of determinates (since every instance of a disjunction is an instance of a disjunct)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epigenesis/
*  Does every individual start from material that is unformed, and the form emerges only gradually, over time? Or does the individual start in some already preformed, or predelineated, or predetermined way? The questions are part metaphysical: what is it that exists — form or also the unformed that becomes the formed? And they are partly epistemological: how do we know — through observation or inference? The debate has persisted since ancient times, and today plays out as genetic determinists appeal to the already “formed” through genetic inheritance, while others insist on the efficacy of environmental plasticity   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/biology-developmental/
*  Developmental biology displays a rich array of material and conceptual practices that can be analyzed to better understand the scientific reasoning exhibited in experimental life science   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evolution-development/
*  In fact, throughout the twentieth century a number of theories have been put forward, which argue that due to the partial independence of genetic and phenotypic variation, evolutionary research should put more emphasis on how the changes in developmental and behavioral patterns might drive or bias evolutionary change   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dewey-moral/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dewey-aesthetics/
*  Rather, Dewey’s naturalism is of an emergent sort, in the sense that he seeks to show how aesthetic experience and culture emerge from the natural basis of life, as he understands it (Alexander 2013)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dewey-political/
*  Democracy is a form of moral and spiritual association that recognizes the contribution that each member can make in his or her particular way to this ethical community   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dewey/
*  Knowing is not the mortal’s exercise of a “divine spark”, either; for while knowing (or inquiry, to use Dewey’s term) includes calculative or rational elements, it is ultimately informed by the body and emotions of the animal using it to cope   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dharmakiirti/

*  Moreover, he distinguished between propositions in the present tense like ‘Helen has three husbands’ and ‘These men are marrying’ and propositions in a tense of completion (the aorist), ‘Helen had three husbands’ and ‘These men married’, and observed that it is possible for propositions like the latter two to be true, without there ever having been a time at which a corresponding one of the former type was true (Sextus Empiricus [SE], Against the Physicists 2   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/diagrams/
* ” The diagram on the right, which represents both “All A are B” and “All B are A,” clearly shows that A is the same as B: In fact, using primary diagrams also avoids some other expressivity problems (to do with spatial properties of diagram objects) discussed below, in Section 3

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dialetheism/
*  The view has been gaining, if not acceptance, the respect of other parties in the debate; one critic writes that dialetheists have shown, as clearly as anything like this can be shown, that it is coherent to maintain that some sentences can be true and false at the same time

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/diderot/
*  Diderot wrote works that we recognize today as philosophy, but he also wrote a great deal more than that, and the challenge presented by his eighteenth-century philosophie is to see the modern philosophy contained in all of it   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/diodorus-cronus/
*  Diodorus, a generation later, can be seen taking up this supposed solution to the Zenonian paradox and showing that it itself in fact generates a new motion paradox, the first of his four   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dilthey/
*  It will be shown that this distinction is not so sharp as to rule out causal explanations in particular human sciences such as psychology, political theory, and economics; it mostly delimits the scope of explanations in these fields   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/doxography-ancient/
*  The simple fact however that Plato, not first and foremost a philosopher of nature, is treated here on the same level as Democritus and the other natural philosophers (as is also the case in the fragments dealing with the principles) should have made them more hesitant, even within the scope of their own hypothesis, as to the interpretation of the title of the foundational treatise in sixteen books   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dietrich-freiberg/
*  Thus it follows according to Aquinas that esse is not included in the understanding of a thing’s essentia, and therefore must be distinct from it   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-dionysius-areopagite/
*  Reading Dionysius’ Works Reading Dionysius can be a difficult business for many reasons: partly because his frequent hyperbolic theological language is foreign to our own English-speaking practices; partly because almost every word he employs resonates with the whole history of ancient thought, from the Christian Platonism of the Fathers, particularly, Gregory of Nyssa and the Cappadocians, to the Neoplatonism of Plotinus, Iamblichus, and Proclus, while his theology focuses predominantly upon the Jewish and Christian scriptures (which Dionysius calls “divine oracles”); partly, again, because the order in which we are to read his works is unclear and because Dionysius mentions at least seven works that have been lost   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dirty-hands/
*  Fourth, how are the circumstances that call for dirty hands best described? Fifth, the dirty hands problem has affinities with the problem raised by moral dilemmas, but the question is: should those similarities be allowed to obscure significant differences? In the course of addressing these issues, the dirty hands challenge is also distinguished from that of political realism, with which it has some affinities, and the resort to role morality to render dirty hands coherent is discussed, as is the issue of the desirability of shaming or punishing dirty hands agents   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/disability-critical/
*  (2006: 2, as quoted in Gillies 2014 and Sleeter 2010) While it is clear, then, that critical disability theory attends to devalued persons, controversy over who the subject of critical disability theory is lies at the heart of the approach   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/disability/
*  There seems to be little about the functional or experiential states of people with these various conditions to justify a common concept; indeed, there is at least as much variation among “disabled” people with respect to their experiences and bodily states as there is among people who lack disabilities   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-disability/
*  Historical accounts of how such individuals fared in a particular society and a particular era are informed by familiar theories about the political function of social roles, applied to the status to which disabled people in that historical period were assigned   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/disability-health/
*  Even if people with a single major disability can live as well as people without one, 1) it requires more effort or luck for them to do so, and 2) they are at greater risk of lacking the means to do so   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/disability-care-rationing/
*  Yet, since it is difficult to clearly separate the general ethical issues from those raised by the focus on disability, we begin in Section 1 by surveying, first, general ethical concerns in health care rationing, and then the specific issues raised by CEA and quality of life as a metric of the “benefit” that health care resources provide   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/disability-justice/
*  By contrast, the various social models see disability as a relationship between individuals and their social environments: physical and mental characteristics are limiting only or primarily in virtue of social practices that lead to the exclusion of people with those characteristics   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/disagreement/
*  How must you respond to the realization in order for your subsequent position on \(B\) to be epistemically rational? Here are the questions for agreement/disagreement plus levels of conviction: Response Question*: Suppose you realize that some people have a confidence level in \(B\) that is different from yours   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/disagreement-moral/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/discourse-representation-theory/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/health-disease/
*  Kitcher (1997, 208–9) summarizes the debate as follows: Some scholars, objectivists about disease, think that there are facts about the human body on which the notion of disease is founded, and that those with a clear grasp of those facts would have no trouble drawing lines, even in the challenging cases

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sophists/
*  Protagoras was one of the earliest sophists; as presented in Plato’s Protagoras (one of our principal sources for Protagoras’ life and activities as a teacher) he says (317c) that he is old enough to be the father of anyone present, who included rival sophists Hippias and Prodicus, while another Plato passage (Meno 91e) says that he practised as a sophist for over forty years till his death at about seventy (probably about 420 BC)

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-distributive/
*  What is the underlying concern, shared by most theorists and the general population, with a society lacking formal equality of opportunity? The concern seems to be rooted in the belief that traits such as a persons’ gender or race are elements over which people have no control and, hence, a society in which people’s race or gender have fundamental effects on their lifetime economic prospects treats people unfairly   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/international-justice/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religious-pluralism/
*  Specifically, our discussion will focus primarily on the following questions: How pervasive is religious diversity? Does the reality of this diversity require a response? Can a person who acknowledges religious diversity remain justified in claiming just one perspective to be correct? If so, is it morally justifiable to attempt to convert others to a different perspective? Can it justifiably be claimed that only one religion offers a path into the eternal presence of God? How should religious diversity be approached in public education? The answers to such questions are not simply academic; they have practical implications   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voluntarism-theological/
*  Some appeal to omnipotence: since God is both omnipotent and impeccable, theological voluntarism must be true: for if God cannot act in a way that is morally wrong, then God’s power would be limited by other normative states of affairs were theological voluntarism not the case   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-will-foreknowledge/
*  It is open to the defender of this solution to maintain that God has no beliefs about the contingent future because he does not infallibly know how it will turn out, and this is compatible with God’s being infallible in everything he does believe   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/divine-freedom/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marriage/
*  But the historical and cultural variation in marital practices has prompted some philosophers to argue that marriage is a ‘family resemblance’ concept, with no essential purpose or structure (Wasserstrom 1974; see also the interesting discussion of whether the many different practices identified by anthropologists as marriage should be counted as marriages in Nolan, forthcoming)

* ) Conceptually, gamete donation provides a valuable ‘lens’ through which to re-examine questions such as: - What grounds parental rights and responsibilities? - What rights and obligations do parents have regarding their children (actual or future) and to what extent can these be transferred or delegated? It also raises questions in practical ethics and policy, such as: - Should there be donor offspring limits (to prevent the same sperm donor having hundreds of biological children)? And, if so, what is the basis for these? - Do donor-conceived children have a right to know about their origins? Should donor anonymity be permitted? - What ‘matching’ and selection decisions should the prospective recipients be allowed to make? What information about donors should they be given? - Is it acceptable to ‘buy and sell’ gametes? And is that any different morally from arrangements in which women are offered heavily discounted fertility treatment services in return for some of their eggs? Such questions are the subject of this entry

*  The simple fact however that Plato, not first and foremost a philosopher of nature, is treated here on the same level as Democritus and the other natural philosophers (as is also the case in the fragments dealing with the principles) should have made them more hesitant, even within the scope of their own hypothesis, as to the interpretation of the title of the foundational treatise in sixteen books   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duhem/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottish-18th/
*  As regards Hobbes, Hutcheson thought his doctrine was both wrong and dangerous; wrong because by the frame of our nature we have compassionate, generous and benevolent affections which owe nothing at all to calculations of self-interest, and dangerous because people may be discouraged from the morally worthy exercise of cultivating generous affections in themselves on the grounds that the exercise of such affections is really an exercise in dissimulation or pretence

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/
*  Just as the eye, because of its particular physical nature, is sensitive to light but not to sound, and the ear to sound and not to light, so, if the intellect were in a physical organ it could be sensitive only to a restricted range of physical things; but this is not the case, for we can think about any kind of material object (De Anima III,4; 429a10–b9)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dubois/
*  From this point of view, Du Bois proposes, it is possible to identify spiritually distinct races as races,[11] and thus to state a definition of race—or, in other words, to specify the historical and social factors that constitute a group of human beings as a race   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ecological-genetics/
*  Most studies in ecological genetics begin with one or the other of the two most prominent patterns in nature: - adaptation, the “fit” between an organism and its environment (see the entry on fitness); or, - polymorphism, the maintenance of two or more phenotypic or genetic forms within a single population by natural selection

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/economics/
*  Most economists and methodologists believe that there is a reasonably clear distinction between facts and values, between what is and what ought to be, and they believe that most of economics should be regarded as a positive science that helps policy makers choose means to accomplish their ends, though it does not bear on the choice of ends itself   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/education-philosophy/
*  Aristotle asked, what constitutes the good life and/or human flourishing, such that education should foster these (Curren 2013)? These two formulations are related, for it is arguable that our educational institutions should aim to equip individuals to pursue this good life—although this is not obvious, both because it is not clear that there is one conception of the good or flourishing life that is the good or flourishing life for everyone, and it is not clear that this is a question that should be settled in advance rather than determined by students for themselves

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ehrenfels/
*  (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 85) Ehrenfels argues that a Gestalt is more (or at least other) than the sum of its parts, which helps to explain how people can remember melodies without having absolute pitch and in different keys, which would be incompatible with the view of melodies as mere sums of tones (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 90 ff

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enlightenment/
*  The faith of the Enlightenment – if one may call it that – is that the process of enlightenment, of becoming progressively self-directed in thought and action through the awakening of one’s intellectual powers, leads ultimately to a better, more fulfilled human existence   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-consequence/
*  This constraint is plausibly thought to be a necessary condition for logical consequence (if it could be that the premises are true and the conclusion isn’t, then there is no doubt that the conclusion does not follow from the premises); however, on most accounts of logical consequence, it is not a sufficient condition for validity

* ) Further, if atoms really are conceptually indivisible, and not just physically unsplittable, then when two atoms pass by each other it is impossible that they should at any time be only partway past, for this would imply a point partway along the length of the atom, which contradicts the premise that it is a minimum   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epiphenomenalism/
*  Further support for epiphenomenalism can be derived from the fact, noted by Wilhelm Wundt (1912), that “each simple sensation is joined to a very complicated combination of peripheral and central nerve processes”, together with the fact that the causes of behavior are likewise complex neural events

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-epistemology/
*  Various feminist epistemologists and philosophers of science argue that dominant knowledge practices disadvantage women by (1) excluding them from inquiry, (2) denying them epistemic authority, (3) denigrating “feminine” cognitive styles, (4) producing theories of women that represent them as inferior, or significant only in the ways they serve male interests, (5) producing theories of social phenomena that render women’s activities and interests, or gendered power relations, invisible, and (6) producing knowledge that is not useful for people in subordinate positions, or that reinforces gender and other social hierarchies   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contextualism-epistemology/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-environmental/
*  Because the intrinsically valuable is that which is good as an end in itself, it is commonly agreed that something’s possession of intrinsic value generates a prima facie direct moral duty on the part of moral agents to protect it or at least refrain from damaging it (see O’Neil 1992 and Jamieson 2002 for detailed accounts of intrinsic value)

*  As a result, researchers using the Internet as a tool for and/or a space of research—and their research ethics boards (REBs), also known as institutional review boards (IRBs) in the United States or human research ethics committees (HRECs) in other countries such as Australia—have been confronted with a series of new ethical questions: What ethical obligations do researchers have to protect the privacy of subjects engaging in activities in “public” Internet spaces? What are such public spaces? Is there any reasonable expectation of privacy in an era of pervasive and ubiquitous surveillance and data tracking? How is confidentiality or anonymity assured online? How is and should informed consent be obtained online? How should research on minors be conducted, and how do you prove a subject is not a minor?

* Personal Identity and Ethics What justifies our holding one person over another morally responsible for a past action? Why am I justified in having a special prudential concern for one particular future person over all others? Why do many of us think that maximizing the good within a single life is perfectly acceptable, but maximizing the good across lives is wrong? For these and other normative questions, it looks like any answer we come up with will have to make essential reference to personal identity   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/
*  This general approach can be applied at different levels to different normative properties of different kinds of things, but the most prominent example is probably consequentialism about the moral rightness of acts, which holds that whether an act is morally right depends only on the consequences of that act or of something related to that act, such as the motive behind the act or a general rule requiring acts of the same kind

*  Someone who is generous, honest, compassionate, and courageous might not be a morally good person—or, if it is still held to be a truism that they are, then morally good people may be led by what makes them morally good to act wrongly! How have we arrived at such an odd conclusion? The answer lies in too ready an acceptance of ordinary usage, which permits a fairly wide-ranging application of many of the virtue terms, combined, perhaps, with a modern readiness to suppose that the virtuous agent is motivated by emotion or inclination, not by rational choice   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/african-ethics/
*  On the terms ‘Ethics’ and ‘Morality’ The term ‘ethics’ is technically used by philosophers to mean a philosophical study of morality—morality understood as a set of social rules, principles, norms that guide or are intended to guide the conduct of people in a society, and as beliefs about right and wrong conduct as well as good or bad character   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/advance-directives/
*  Once the current self falls below a certain threshold of capacity, her interests in her current state are so marginal as to no longer be authoritative for how she ought to be cared for, and the interests of the earlier self trump   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-search/
*  Search Engine Development and Evolution: A Short History Because search engines provide Internet users with access to important information by directing them to links to available online resources on a plethora of topics, many are inclined to see search engine technology in a positive light; some might also assume, as Noble (2018) and others note, that this technology is “value-neutral   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thick-ethical-concepts/
*  The interesting feature of thick terms and concepts is that even if they count as evaluative on a binary distinction, they are supposed to straddle the distinction   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-it-phenomenology/
*  It is this way of thinking about information technology, as co-original with the human, and as a horizon of meaning and action, that we want to elaborate further before we can elaborate how these various ways of conceptualizing technology shape our views on the social and ethical implications of such technologies   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cloning/
*  An important, and for many people troubling question arose: if the cloning of sheep is possible, will scientists soon start cloning humans as well; and if they did, would this be wrong or unwise? For most people, Dolly was really a wolf in sheep’s clothing   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chimeras/
*  Finally, the Moral Status Framework maintains that research in which a non-human animal’s moral status is enhanced to that of a normal adult human is impermissible unless reasonable assurances are in place that its new moral status will be respected, which is unlikely given the motivations for chimeric research and the oversight likely to be provided   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/clinical-research/
*  This brings us to the central ethical challenge posed by clinical research: When is it ethically permissible to expose research participants to risks of harm for the benefit of others? The present entry focuses on this concern, and canvasses the most prominent attempts to address it   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-capacity/
*  But what exactly does it mean to say that a subject has or lacks the requisite capacity to decide? This question has to do with what is commonly called “decisional capacity”, a central concept in health care law and ethics, and increasingly an independent topic of philosophical inquiry   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/disability/
*  There seems to be little about the functional or experiential states of people with these various conditions to justify a common concept; indeed, there is at least as much variation among “disabled” people with respect to their experiences and bodily states as there is among people who lack disabilities   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/health-disease/
*  Kitcher (1997, 208–9) summarizes the debate as follows: Some scholars, objectivists about disease, think that there are facts about the human body on which the notion of disease is founded, and that those with a clear grasp of those facts would have no trouble drawing lines, even in the challenging cases   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-healthcareaccess/
*  How, for example, do we actually tell if access to care is equal or equitable? The problem of measuring access to care aside, we might think that the concept of equal access is straightforwardly analyzed, and the concept of equitable access depends in a more complex way on what inequalities in access are permissible   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/organ-donation/
*  What are these claims? What would it be to respect them? How should they fit with the claims of organ donors’ families or the needs of people whose own organs have failed? And then how should organs be allocated? Who should get priority and why? As with other topics in applied ethics, satisfactory answers require knowing the relevant facts, in this case about organ transplantation   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gametes-donation-sale/
* ) Conceptually, gamete donation provides a valuable ‘lens’ through which to re-examine questions such as: - What grounds parental rights and responsibilities? - What rights and obligations do parents have regarding their children (actual or future) and to what extent can these be transferred or delegated? It also raises questions in practical ethics and policy, such as: - Should there be donor offspring limits (to prevent the same sperm donor having hundreds of biological children)? And, if so, what is the basis for these? - Do donor-conceived children have a right to know about their origins? Should donor anonymity be permitted? - What ‘matching’ and selection decisions should the prospective recipients be allowed to make? What information about donors should they be given? - Is it acceptable to ‘buy and sell’ gametes? And is that any different morally from arrangements in which women are offered heavily discounted fertility treatment services in return for some of their eggs? Such questions are the subject of this entry   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-inequality-health/
*  So what makes a health inequality an injustice, when it is one? Do health inequalities have some significance in justice that differs from other important inequalities? Or is the injustice of an unjust inequality in health simply due to the application of general principles of equality and justice to the case of health? To answer these questions, one has to examine two rather different literatures   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enhancement/
*  If the normal function account is taken seriously as a biomedical boundary marker, how does one defend this kind of prevention? Conversely, if preventive interventions like these are acceptable in medicine, what can it mean to claim that researchers and clinicians should be “drawing the line” at enhancement? 2   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stem-cells/
*  It also encompasses questions about, among other things, whether researchers who use but do not derive HESCs are complicit in the destruction of embryos, whether there is a moral distinction between creating embryos for research purposes and creating them for reproductive ends, the permissibility of cloning human embryos to harvest HESCs, and the ethics of creating human/non-human chimeras   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-pregnancy/
*  We will then move on to three categories of ethical issues: (1) issues arising in the course of obstetrical care for women who are taken to be competent and capable of autonomous decision-making; (2) issues that arise when women are decisionally incompetent or when their right to decisional autonomy is in question; (3) issues concerning the management and communication of reproductive risk   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/privacy-medicine/
*  She has argued that the demand for confidentiality in psychiatric medicine is inadequately accounted for on theories that fail to take into account the virtues of trust and reserve that are hallmarks of mental health care   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/theory-bioethics/
*  So when asked to consider the role of moral theorizing in bioethics, a natural position of such philosophers is that moral theory has a crucial, if not indispensable, role   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/organs-sale/
*  It may be objected to empirically, with the critic arguing either that permitting organ sale would be ineffective or that an alternative system would work better: for example, the ways in which we approach bereaved relatives could be improved, as could the ways in which the possibility of (unpaid) living donation is publicized, or there could be a move to a Mandated Choice or Presumed Consent system (Hinkley 2005)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/euthanasia-voluntary/
*  This position appears to be at odds with the well-established right of a competent patient to refuse life-prolonging medical treatment, at least when further treatment is refused because she considers that her life no longer has value for her and further treatment will not restore its value to her   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/informed-consent/
*  This being the case, why is it important—as it seems to many of us and as is enshrined in law—to honor the requirement of informed consent? For example, why honor the requirement when a fully capacitated Jehovah’s Witness refuses a blood transfusion on religious grounds? Why honor it when health is not at stake, for example, in experiments on stored tissue? Finally, specifically from a utilitarian standpoint, why honor the requirement on occasions when it seems to set back collective health, for example, when we cannot develop a new drug that would help many, because no one is altruistic enough to consent to participate in its risky study? 2   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/events/
* ) From this point of view, events are to be distinguished from facts, which are characterized by features of abstractness and a-temporality: the event of Caesar’s death took place in Rome in 44 BCE, but that Caesar died is a fact here as in Rome, today as in 44 BCE   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/eugenics/
*  Finally, advances in genetic technology suggest the possibility that our ability to test for (if not manipulate directly) a much larger array of genes and genetic markers related to a wide variety of diseases and traits may be on the near horizon   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ancient/
*  However, in order to explain virtue as a good of the soul, one does not have to hold that the soul is immortal   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/publichealth-ethics/
*  Because these differences frequently co-travel with indices of disadvantage and power, and because health is viewed by many as a core dimension of human welfare or flourishing, some frame the foundation or justification of public health in terms of fairness and justice – much in the way that significant disparities in resources or liberties are generally framed   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evidence/
*  Similarly, one longstanding controversy that divides realists and antirealists in the philosophy of science can be understood as a debate about whether the kind of evidence which is available to scientists is ever sufficient to justify belief in theories that quantify over entities that are in principle unobservable, such as electrons or quarks   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evolution/
*  This yielded a prevalent—probably the most prevalent—understanding of evolution as “any change in the frequency of alleles within a population from one generation to the next”   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil-kinds-origins/
*  Taken to its logical extreme, the doctrine held by people in this camp is that all evil has “moral” origins—it is a product of choice or agency of some sort   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evidence-legal/
*  The second definition is contained in the United States’ Federal Rule of Evidence 401 which (in its restyled version) states that evidence is relevant if “it has a tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence” (emphasis added)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/confirmation/
*  The basic version (sometimes labelled “naïve”) of the HD notion of confirmation can be spelled out thus: For any \(h, e, k \in \bL\) such that \(h\wedge k\) is consistent: - \(e\) HD-confirms \(h\) relative to \(k\) if and only if \(h\wedge k \vDash e\) and \(k \not\vDash e\); - \(e\) HD-disconfirms \(h\) relative to \(k\) if and only if \(h\wedge k \vDash \neg e\), and \(k \not\vDash \neg e\); - \(e\) is HD-neutral for hypothesis \(h\) relative to \(k\) otherwise

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evolution-cultural/
*  Cultural evolutionary theory in general requires only a systematic effort to model the effects of cultural inheritance, and one might decide that thinking in terms of natural selection acting on units of culture is not the best way of doing this   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evolution-before-darwin/

*  The key idea is that there is no sense to the idea of a general problem solver and that no headway can be made in cognitive science without breaking down problems into their component parts   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/
*  It seems possible, then, that there might be evils that are logically necessary for goods that outweigh them, and this possibility provides a reason, accordingly, for questioning one of the premises in the argument set out earlier—namely, premise (4), where it is claimed that if God is morally perfect, then God has the desire to eliminate all evil

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-biology/
*  The above sorts of questions, which are receiving growing attention in the sciences, all pertain to morality understood as a set of empirical phenomena to be explained: it is an empirical fact about human beings that we make moral judgments, have certain feelings and behave in certain ways, and it is natural for the sciences to seek causal explanations for such phenomena   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetics-existentialist/
*  Art as revelation of the world Sartre draws a basic aesthetic implication from the thesis that meaning in the world depends on acts of consciousness: the fundamental aim of the work of art is to deliberately and consistently exert this uniquely human quality to introduce meaningful order and regularities into the world   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/experimental-philosophy/
*  - When an agent correctly believes that an outcome will arise but is only correct in this belief as the result of a coincidence, people are more inclined to say that she has knowledge when the outcome is morally bad than when it is morally good (Beebe & Shea 2013; Buckwalter 2014)

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-evolutionary/
* ” It is perhaps doubly paradoxical, then, that the subsequent development of evolutionary game theory has produced a theory which holds great promise for social scientists, and is as readily applied to the field of economic behaviour as that for which it was originally designed   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/experimental-moral/
*  Contemporary philosophers have not been uniformly accepting of the movement, but as we will see, there are reasons to think that experimental evidence might have a distinctive role, significance, and importance in moral philosophy and theorizing   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/exploitation/
* 2 Marx’s Theory of Exploitation By far the most influential theory of exploitation ever set forth is that of Karl Marx, who held that workers in a capitalist society are exploited insofar as they are forced to sell their labor power to capitalists for less than the full value of the commodities they produce with their labor   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/biology-experiment/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathematics-explanation/
*  And since many of the non-causal explanations that have been discussed in the literature are mathematical explanations, this area of philosophy of science is fueled by concerns related to the nature of scientific explanation   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaphysical-explanation/
*  Our goal in the present entry, however, is not to provide a full accounting of how the concept has developed over time—here, we focus on framing the main questions and disputes that emerge when one attempts to state what metaphysical explanation is, exactly, and how it is supposed to work (if at all)

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physics-experiment/
*  Hacking’s question really asked how do we come to believe in an experimental result obtained with a complex experimental apparatus? How do we distinguish between a valid result[2] and an artifact created by that apparatus? If experiment is to play all of the important roles in science mentioned above and to provide the evidential basis for scientific knowledge, then we must have good reasons to believe in those results   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-explanation/
*  With respect to the second contrast, most models of explanation assume that it is possible for a set of claims to be true, accurate, supported by evidence, and so on and yet unexplanatory   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intrinsic-extrinsic/
*  - (7) It is possible for there to be a sentence ‘\(a\) is \(F\)’, where \(F\) expresses an intrinsic property and ‘\(a\) is \(F\)’ expresses a foundational fact in the sense of being a fact that is not metaphysically grounded by any other fact

*  Spelman notes that in parts of The Second Sex de Beauvoir recognizes that if one is not born but rather becomes a woman, it is not the same to become a white woman as it is to become a black one, for example, and not the same to become a bourgeois woman as it is to become a proletarian one   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-philosophy/
*  In an effort to suggest a schematic account of feminism, Susan James characterizes feminism as follows: Feminism is grounded on the belief that women are oppressed or disadvantaged by comparison with men, and that their oppression is in some way illegitimate or unjustified   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/femapproach-analytic/
*  Feminists seek “engaged” philosophy that is potentially useful to empower human beings rather than contribute to the perpetuation of a status quo in which people are subordinated by gender, race/ethnicity, class, sexual orientation, and so on   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-latin-america/
*  The origins of Latin American feminist ideas can be found in reflections on conditions of otherness that emerge as a result of colonialism and in critiques of norms that render the category of man the entry point for humanity

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-bioethics/
*  During the 1980s, feminists in particular argued that bioethics was developing in a way that gave too little attention to gender-specific disparities in healthcare research and therapy, or to the effects of other power disparities, such as class and ethnicity, on quality of healthcare   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-psychoanalysis/
*  The boy and the girl start off, pre-Oedipally, in the same emotional place, attached to the mother, and it is because of this shared starting point that Freud claims the little girl is a little man; they are not yet distinct or sexually differentiated   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-environmental/
*  Unlike canonical Western ethics, Western environmental ethics (both feminist and non-feminist) is predicated on the claim that humans have moral responsibilities (or obligations) to nonhuman animals and/or nature, although they disagree about the basis of these responsibilities

*  They criticize and aim to correct the privileging of men as the more morally worthy half of the binary, or argue against the maintenance of a social order that oppresses others in gendered ways   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-epistemology/
*  Various feminist epistemologists and philosophers of science argue that dominant knowledge practices disadvantage women by (1) excluding them from inquiry, (2) denying them epistemic authority, (3) denigrating “feminine” cognitive styles, (4) producing theories of women that represent them as inferior, or significant only in the ways they serve male interests, (5) producing theories of social phenomena that render women’s activities and interests, or gendered power relations, invisible, and (6) producing knowledge that is not useful for people in subordinate positions, or that reinforces gender and other social hierarchies   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/
*  So, it is interesting to explore how and why feminist philosophers came to the realization that gender is a useful analytic category to apply to the history of philosophy   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-metaphysics/
*  Here is her account of gender (Haslanger 2012: 234): S is a woman if and only if - S is regularly and for the most part observed or imagined to have certain bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female’s biological role in reproduction; - that S has these features marks S within the dominant ideology of S’s society as someone who ought to occupy certain kinds of social position that are in fact subordinate (and so motivates and justifies S occupying such a position); and - the fact that S satisfies (i) and (ii) plays a role in S’s systematic subordination, that is, along some dimension, S’s social position is oppressive, and S’s satisfying (i) and (ii) plays a role in that dimension of subordination   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-liberal/
*  Egalitarian-liberal feminists hold that much can and should be done to support the personal and political autonomy of women and to achieve parity in the processes of democratic self-governance in liberal societies like the United States   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-moralpsych/
*  To what extent are we responsible for our actions when they are motivated by desires deformed by patriarchy? Are victims of oppression in any way responsible for their own oppression? Are they responsible for resisting oppression? Are members of the dominant social group responsible for understanding oppression, and how can they come to understand it? Are men collectively responsible for women’s oppression, even when it is not the case that each man harbors sexist intentions? - 1   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-philosophy-biology/
*  Philosophy of biology is often informed by a naturalistic approach, meaning that the work is closely tied to the actual history and practice of the science in question

*  Far from the days of wondering what Athens has to do with Jerusalem, philosophy and religion appeared to have entered a period of detente as comrades in arms   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-autonomy/
*  The notion of self implicit in the Kantian and Rawlsian accounts is said to be “atomistic”; that is, it is abstracted from the social relations in which actual agents are embedded   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-class/
*  It will also be necessary to consider various philosophical approaches to the concept of work, the way that women’s work and household activities are subsumed or not under this category, how the specific features of this work may or may not connect to different “ways of knowing” and different approaches to ethics, and the debate between essentialist and social constructionist approaches to differences between the sexes as a base for the sexual division of labor in most known human societies   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-argumentation/
*  These approaches can provide a potent basis for generating alternatives to eristic standards and an understanding of the processes that may go alongside or support arguing as a contest   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-social-epistemology/
*  Additionally, many feminist social epistemologists who ultimately reject standpoint theory have adopted some form of the idea that social location is connected to epistemic perspective in significant ways, and hence that knowers are differentiated   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-disability/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-globalization/
*  Others see the promise of political globalization in transnational feminist solidarity networks, such as the women’s rights are human rights campaign and groups combating sex trafficking, global care chains, and labor exploitation that enable feminist resistance to dominant political and economic forces (Copelon 2003, Gallegos 2017, Hochschild 2000, 2002, Kittay, 2008, 2009, Parekh 2009, Robinson 2003, Stamatopoulou 1995, Walby 2002, Weir 2005)

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-power/
*  (Note that this statement amounts to a significant revision of Lukes’s earlier analysis of power, in which he argued against defining power as power-to on the grounds that such a definition obscures “the conflictual aspect of power – the fact that it is exercised over people” and thus fails to address what we care about most when we decide to study power (1974, 31)

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-body/
*  Moreover, in the writings of Cady Stanton we find a recognition of the way bodily markers are used to perpetuate both racial and sexual oppression: The prejudice against color, of which we hear so much, is no stronger than that against sex   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottish-19th/
*  Brown was a poet and physician as well as a philosopher, and a rather more independent thinker than Stewart, so much so, in fact, that Stewart regarded him as something of a traitor to the philosophy of Reid   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottish-18th/
*  As regards Hobbes, Hutcheson thought his doctrine was both wrong and dangerous; wrong because by the frame of our nature we have compassionate, generous and benevolent affections which owe nothing at all to calculations of self-interest, and dangerous because people may be discouraged from the morally worthy exercise of cultivating generous affections in themselves on the grounds that the exercise of such affections is really an exercise in dissimulation or pretence   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-trans/
*  The goal in this entry is to outline some of the key philosophical issues at the intersections, and this can be accomplished only by attending to the history of feminist and trans politics as it has unfolded in the U   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ludwig-feuerbach/
* [5] That Feuerbach is generally remembered as an atheist and a materialist has tended to obscure the fact that he began his philosophical career as an enthusiastic adherent of this philosophical religion, one early expression of which can be found in the Greek words “Hen kai Pan” (One and All) inscribed in 1791 by Hölderlin in Hegel’s student album from Tübingen (cf   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ficino/
*  The precise course of Ficino’s education is uncertain, but it is plausible that from a young age he was exposed to the medical traditions shared by his father (folk elements, no doubt, had their part in these traditions, even if those elements are not often recorded)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/johann-fichte/
*  Schulze’s Aenesidemus, the first full-scale public announcement of the same came in a short manifesto that he published as a means of introducing himself to his new students and colleagues at Jena and attracting listeners to his lectures   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feyerabend/
*  Despite the fact that Feyerabend reports of himself that he was foolhardy during battle, treating it as a theatrical event, he received the Iron Cross (second class) early in March 1944, for leading his men into a village under enemy fire, and occupying it   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fiction/
*  This opposes it to non-fiction; even if a work of non-fiction misrepresents the world, it is not intended by its author to be recognized as something that misrepresents the world   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fictionalism/
*  The linguistic thesis is, roughly, that already expressed above, according to which utterances of sentences of the discourse are best seen not as efforts to say what is literally true, but as useful fictions of some sort   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fictional-entities/
* 1 Possibilism One way to account for the nonexistence datum is the possibilist theory of fictional entities, which holds that fictional entities do not exist in the actual world but only in some other possible worlds   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fictionalism-mathematics/
*  Fictionalism, on the other hand, is the view that (a) our mathematical sentences and theories do purport to be about abstract mathematical objects, as platonism suggests, but (b) there are no such things as abstract objects, and so (c) our mathematical theories are not true   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/
*  Granting that reason is indeed neutral with respect to the question of whether or not God exists, it might at first be thought that the safest and most rational course of action would be to refuse to take a stand one way or the other—to remain agnostic about the existence of God   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fictionalism-modal/
*  440), and while Nolt does not tell us specifically what theory of make-believe he has in mind, there are many theories of make-believe (most famously Walton 1990) that might be employed by a modal fictionalist to explain the behaviour of our typical utterances about possible worlds   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/film/
*  Suffice it to say here that changes in both academic philosophy and the cultural role of the movies in general made it imperative for philosophers to take film seriously as an artform on a par with the more traditional ones like theater, dance, and painting   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/money-finance/
*  The commodity theory of money: A classic theory, which goes back all the way to Aristotle (Politics, 1255b–1256b), holds that money is a kind of commodity that fulfills three functions: it serves as (i) a medium of exchange, (ii) a unit of account, and (iii) a store of value   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/findlay/
*  The later writings of the 1970s are footnotes and supplements to what is given in these three books from the 1960s   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fine-tuning/
*  Various reactions to the universe’s fine-tuning for life have been proposed: that it is a lucky coincidence which we have to accept as a primitive given; that it will be avoided by future best theories of fundamental physics; that the universe was created by some divine designer who established life-friendly conditions; and that fine-tuning for life indicates the existence of multiple other universes with conditions very different from those in our own universe   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fitch-paradox/
*  The middle way, what we might call moderate antirealism, can be characterized logically somewhere in the ballpark of the knowability principle:\[\tag{K Principle} \forall p(p \rightarrow \Diamond Kp), \] which says, formally, for all propositions \(p\), if \(p\) then it is possible to know that \(p\)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fitness/
*  But what is fitness and how can one tell when a trait enhances fitness, or more to the point, when one organism is fitter than another? Opponents of the theory of natural selection have long claimed that the theory is so treated by its proponents as to define fitness in terms of rates of reproduction, thus condemning the principle of the survival of the fittest to triviality: the claim that those organisms with higher rates of reproduction leave more offspring is an empty, unfalsifiable tautology bereft of explanatory power   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fitzralph/
*  Leff’s summation of FitzRalph is rather negative, holding that FitzRalph shows an unwillingness to be deeply involved in the controversies of his time, and that he was content to “restate what his contemporaries re-formulated” (Leff 1963: 175)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fitting-attitude-theories/
*  This is to say that values such as the good and the funny are to be understood in terms of what one ought, or has most reason, to feel   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/folkpsych-theory/
*  To adopt a light-duty TT view of FP’s ontological commitments is to hold that, however useful FP is in everyday contexts, the crude predictions and explanations it sponsors are not the sort that can seriously predict or explain the behavior of others   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philippa-foot/
*  Rather, to feel pride in something is to see it as one’s achievement; hence the object of pride is taken to a good that one had some hand in bringing about   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/folkpsych-simulation/
*  More precisely, in order for mental state M* to be a mental simulation of mental state M, it has to be case that: (i) cognitive processes P* and P, which respectively generate M* and M, are both implemented by the same (type of) cognitive mechanism C; (ii) P is implemented by the use of C, while P* is implemented by the reuse of C   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fleck/
*  Thought styles are often incommensurable: what is a fact to the members of a thought collective A sometimes does not exist to the members of a thought collective B, and a thought that is significant and true to the members of A may sometimes be false or meaningless for members of B   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/forgiveness/
*  Although on some views forgiveness is also an offer, especially where reconciliation between a victim and wrongdoer is attempted (Tombs 2008), the main sense of forgiveness seems not to involve the idea of an offer at all, let alone an offer that must be accepted by the wrongdoer in order for forgiveness to occur and accomplish at least some of its ends, for example to discharge one’s duty to forgive others as commanded by God, or to move beyond a potentially paralyzing negative emotion   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-will-foreknowledge/
*  It is open to the defender of this solution to maintain that God has no beliefs about the contingent future because he does not infallibly know how it will turn out, and this is compatible with God’s being infallible in everything he does believe   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/formalism-mathematics/
*  Game and Term Formalism Frege does not extract a unified, consistent position from the work of Heine and Thomae, and much of his criticism is devoted to showing that they inconsistently slip into modes of thought which are only appropriate for ‘contentful’ arithmetic, which Frege takes to be a body of truths expressed by utterances in which numerical expressions designate abstract referents independent of the mind (or at least any particular individual’s mind)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/form-matter/
*  It is crucial that a thing’s matter can survive such changes, if it is to play the role that Aristotle needs it to play in cases of substantial generation and destruction, as being the thing that underlies such changes   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frame-problem/
*  This makes it impossible to express a rule that has an open-ended set of exceptions, and the common sense law of inertia is just such a rule   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/formal-epistemology/
*  This says we can calculate how likely two statements \(A\) and \(B\) are to be true together by temporarily taking \(B\) for granted, assessing the probability of \(A\) in that light, and then giving the result as much weight as \(B\)’s probability on its own merits   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/francis-marchia/
*  Here it must be stressed at the outset that Francis of Marchia was not a faithful Scotist, contrary to a common opinion based on misconceptions from early in the twentieth century   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-association/
*  Key questions concern, first, our degree of freedom to decide who is in and who is out: When may we refuse to associate with other people? When may we leave the associations we are in? When may we deny someone membership in our association? When may third-parties, such as the state, sever, compel, or intrude upon our associations? Second, key questions concern our degree of freedom to decide what to do as associates: What level of control should we have over the internal workings of our associations, especially if those workings harm either members or non-members? To what extent may we radically reshape, and thereby redefine, the associations we are in? The answers to these two sets of questions will provide a unifying analysis of the vast and seemingly disparate array of associations to which we can belong   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/divine-freedom/
*  But if his perfect goodness requires him to create the good world, how is it possible that he was free to create the inferior world or not to create any world? This is a simple way of picturing the problem of divine perfection and divine freedom   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-ancient/
*  The Stoics, on the other hand, affirm that every single event is causally determined by God in accordance with his providential plan, and they try to show how what we do is under our control in such a world   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/
*  In the above story you appear, in this sense, to be unfree: you are not in control of your own destiny, as you are failing to control a passion that you yourself would rather be rid of and which is preventing you from realizing what you recognize to be your true interests   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/temporal-parts/
*  There’s no mystery here, any more than there is mystery in your being both hot and cold by having a hot head and cold feet: we’re all familiar with the fact that different parts of the same object can have different properties   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-metaphysics/
*  Understanding Being, the way in which Beauty is beautiful, that is, determining what it is for a Form to self-predicate, is central to understanding Plato's Theory of Forms and his middle period metaphysics   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-rider/
*  Suppose that, in the status quo, I have a car and you have $5000 but that both of us would prefer to have what the other has   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/critical-theory/
*  The positive goal of such a theory is not only to provide an account of rationality based on this know-how that is rich enough to grasp uses of reason in all their variety, yet also normative enough to be able to clarify the necessary conditions for its practical employment as well as a critical analysis of the “pathologies” that occur when these conditions fail to obtain   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/
*  It is true that many human rights documents give a prominent place to the right to speech and conscience, but such documents also place limits on what can be said because of the harm and offense that unlimited speech can cause, (I will discuss this in more detail later)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/formal-belief/
*  Accepting both Rational Monotonicity and Conditionalization amounts to saying that when confronted with new evidence that is logically consistent with her beliefs, a rational agent responds by simply forming the deductive closure of her existing beliefs with the new evidence   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frege-hilbert/
*  As Hilbert says, [I]t is surely obvious that every theory is only a scaffolding or schema of concepts together with their necessary relations to one another, and that the basic elements can be thought of in any way one likes   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incompatibilism-theories/
*  When these conditions are satisfied, it is held, the agent exercises in performing her action a certain variety of active control (which is said to consist in the action’s being caused, in an appropriate way, by those agent-involving events), the action is performed for a reason, and there remains, until she acts, a chance of the agent’s not performing that action   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/
*  The topic of free will also gives rise to purely empirical questions that are beginning to be explored in the human sciences: do we have it, and to what degree? Here is an overview of what follows   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-will-foreknowledge/
*  It is open to the defender of this solution to maintain that God has no beliefs about the contingent future because he does not infallibly know how it will turn out, and this is compatible with God’s being infallible in everything he does believe   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fuller-margaret/
*  Starting in 1846, at her own initiative Fuller moved to Europe, first to England and then to the Italian peninsula (Italy was not yet a united country), where she served as a foreign correspondent for Greeley   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frege/
*  In this formal system, Frege developed an analysis of quantified statements and formalized the notion of a ‘proof’ in terms that are still accepted today   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/teleology-biology/
*  In this article, we hope to bring some clarity to the contemporary debates over the role of teleological notions in biology by sketching a taxonomy of the various accounts of biological function on offer (see Allen & Bekoff 1995 for a more comprehensive taxonomy that forms the basis of this presentation)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/friendship/
*  Although it is a bit unclear how to understand these distinctions, the basic idea seems to be that pleasure, utility, and virtue are the reasons we have in these various kinds of relationships for loving our friend   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/propositional-function/
*  Building on this, we can see that the complete concept of a term will include enough to ground any truth about it as well   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frege-theorem/
*  We can see these principles at work by formulating the following instance of comprehension, where ‘\(Ox\)’ asserts that \(x\) is odd: \(\exists G\forall x(Gx \equiv (Ox \amp x \gt 5))\) This asserts: there exists a concept \(G\) such that for every object \(x\), \(x\) falls under \(G\) if and only if \(x\) is odd and greater than 5   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-futcont/
*  The second interpretation insists that Aristotle’s point is not to deny the truth-value of these statements, but their being true in the same way as other statements are true   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/functionalism/
*  For (an avowedly simplistic) example, a functionalist theory might characterize pain as a state that tends to be caused by bodily injury, to produce the belief that something is wrong with the body and the desire to be out of that state, to produce anxiety, and, in the absence of any stronger, conflicting desires, to cause wincing or moaning   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gadamer/
*  The way in which Gadamer conceives of understanding, and interpretation, is as just such a practically oriented mode of insight—a mode of insight that has its own rationality irreducible to any simple rule or set of rules, that cannot be directly taught, and that is always oriented to the particular case at hand   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gadamer-aesthetics/
*  The claim that a work of art “says something to someone” (Palmer 2001, 70) alludes to the surprise, shock and, sometimes, dismay at being directly affected by what is in a work and of being forced to reflect on its claim so that it becomes more understandable to both oneself and others   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fundamentality/
*  The second task may be applied to relative fundamentality and used to express the idea that there is a hierarchy of being whereby some entities are more fundamental than others, although strictly speaking this hierarchical picture is independent of the notion of a complete basis   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/future-contingents/
*  This means that among the possible contingent futures there must be one which has a special status, namely that it corresponds to the course of events which is going to happen or take place in the future   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/galileo/
*  This move left Galileo with a problem: what is heaviness and how is it to be described? In De Motu, he argued that the moving arms of a balance could be used as a model for treating all problems of natural motion

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/recursive-functions/
*  The sense of this phrase is clarified by the following properties of the system he describes: - the natural numbers are taken as basic objects together with the successor function \(x + 1\); - it is assumed that descriptive functions proven to be equal may be substituted for one another in other expressions; - all definitions of functions and relations on natural numbers are given by recursion; - functional assertions such as (\ref{funassert}) must be proven by induction   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/games-abstraction/
*  In order to carry out a semantical analysis of PCF, we need a theory of data types with partial elements and of functions over them that support an abstract form of recursive definition through fixed point equations: this is what is achieved in Scott’s theory of domains, the original mathematical foundation for denotational semantics of programming languages as conceived by Strachey (1966, 1967)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gelukpa/
*  The negative dialectics of the Middle Way (madhyamaka) is the centerpiece of the Geluk intellectual tradition and is the philosophy that is commonly held in Tibet to represent the highest view   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-evolutionary/
* ” It is perhaps doubly paradoxical, then, that the subsequent development of evolutionary game theory has produced a theory which holds great promise for social scientists, and is as readily applied to the field of economic behaviour as that for which it was originally designed   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gangesa/
*  If the Mīmāṃsaka position were correct, it would not be possible to doubt the veridicality of, for example, a perception that is indeed an instance of knowledge, both veridical and produced in the right way   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gene/
*  The concept of the gene, emerging out of a century of genetic research, has been and continues to be, as Raphael Falk has reminded us not so long ago, a “concept in tension” (Falk 2000)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/genetic-drift/
*  Jessica Pfeifer (2005) weighs in on the disagreement between Millstein and Brandon, arguing that it is reasonable to think that the source of probabilities in natural selection are at least partly a result of abstracting from or ignoring certain features of the environment and that, if this view is adopted, it is not conceptually confused to treat selection and drift as causally distinct   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/genrel-early/
*  To an emerging logical empiricism, the philosophical significance of relativity theory was above all methodological, that conventions must first be laid down in order to express the empirical content of a physical theory   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/generics/
*  “Ducks lay eggs” and “a lion has a mane” are more forgiving still; these generics are true even though it is only the mature members of one sex that possess the relevant properties   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gassendi/
*  First, in the case of empirical knowledge, Gassendi proposes that the Cartesian criterion fails on classical Skeptical grounds: it is possible for us to have ideas from the senses we take to be clear and distinct which are nevertheless not the basis for warranted claims to empirical knowledge of a general nature   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/generalized-quantifiers/
*  In fact, the only significant difference between Frege’s notion of a second-level concept and the modern notion of a generalized quantifier is that Frege did not have the idea of an interpretation or model, which we now (since the advent of model theory in the 1950s) see as a universe that the quantifiers range over, plus an assignment of suitable semantic objects to the non-logical symbols   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-ethics/
*  More precisely, it provides a model of how agents satisfying certain criteria of rationality interact in games characterized by the actions or strategies available to each of the agents and the payoffs they can achieve   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ecological-genetics/
*  Most studies in ecological genetics begin with one or the other of the two most prominent patterns in nature: - adaptation, the “fit” between an organism and its environment (see the entry on fitness); or, - polymorphism, the maintenance of two or more phenotypic or genetic forms within a single population by natural selection   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logics-for-games/
*  In this perspective, a player can force the outcome of the game to be in some set X if she commands a strategy that ensures the game to end up in an outcome of X, no matter what the other players do (van der Hoek & Pauly 2007)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/geometry-19th/
*  Given any segment PQ, draw a straight line a through P and a straight line b through Q, so that a and b lie on the same plane; verify that the angles that a and b make with PQ on one of the two sides of PQ add up to less than two right angles; if this condition is satisfied, it should be granted that a and b meet at a point R on that same side of PQ, thus forming the triangle PQR   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/population-genetics/
*  Suppose that at a given locus, or chromosomal ‘slot’, there are two possible alleles, A1 and A2; the locus is assumed to be on an autosome, not a sex chromosome   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/genetics/
*  So it should not be surprising that philosophers have gravitated to genetics in an attempt to understand how that science works, what it says about the world, and what impact it has on people living in a society where there is so much focus on genes   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/geometry-finitism/
*  For, if such is the case, the latter geometry can easily be replaced by a discrete version in any physical theory that makes use of this particular mathematical background   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-geometry/
*  Before the 19th century only one geometry was studied in any depth or thought to be an accurate or correct description of physical space, and that was Euclidean geometry   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/genomics/
*  The problem here is just that even passing over the well-known problems with saying what a gene is (see Barnes & Dupré 2008; SEP entry on the gene), on any tenable account of genes, there is far more to the genome than genes, and only a fraction of the actual DNA contained in the chromosomes would be part of the genome, at least in the case of humans and other organisms that have a relatively large amount of non-coding DNA (Barnes & Dupré 2008: 76)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/genotype-phenotype/
*  What then is to be accentuated and what de-emphasized about a genotype and phenotype, as DNA and traits or as classes—especially when asking any of the previous questions? And how—by what concepts, methods, and models—is what has been de-emphasized to be brought back and re-integrated into the scientific account? To make sense of the original meanings of the terms and the distinction between them as well as the coexistence of different kinds of meanings since then, a specific kind of abstraction (see entry on abstract objects) is pertinent, namely, the material practices of control over biological materials and conditions advanced in modern experimental biology and agricultural breeding or entailed in the allied use of models in analysis of data   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/molecular-genetics/
* Molecular Genetics The term molecular genetics sometimes refers to a fundamental theory alleging that genes direct all life processes through the production of polypeptides, sometimes to a more modest basic theory about the expression and regulation of genes at the molecular level, and sometimes to an investigative approach applied throughout biomedical science that is based on investigative strategies grounded in the basic theory about genes   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemic-game/
*  While all types of uncertainty may play a role in an epistemic analysis of a game, a distinguishing feature of epistemic game theory is an insistence that rational decisions are assessed in terms of the players’ preferences and beliefs about what their opponents are going to do   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/giles/
*  From Giles’ will we know that he was sent to Paris to study in the convent of his Order   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/globalization/
*  Although sharp differences continue to separate participants in the ongoing debate about the term, most contemporary social theorists endorse the view that globalization refers to fundamental changes in the spatial and temporal contours of social existence, according to which the significance of space or territory undergoes shifts in the face of a no less dramatic acceleration in the temporal structure of crucial forms of human activity   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottish-18th/
*  As regards Hobbes, Hutcheson thought his doctrine was both wrong and dangerous; wrong because by the frame of our nature we have compassionate, generous and benevolent affections which owe nothing at all to calculations of self-interest, and dangerous because people may be discouraged from the morally worthy exercise of cultivating generous affections in themselves on the grounds that the exercise of such affections is really an exercise in dissimulation or pretence

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/18thGerman-preKant/
*  This new anti-authoritarian cast of mind is clearly evident in a dissertation on bigamy of 1685, in which Thomasius defends the practice as consistent with natural law, and which unsurprisingly led to a confrontation with a professor in the theology faculty at Leipzig   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-theory/
*  Since game theory is about economically rational action given the strategically significant actions of others, it should not surprise you to be told that what agents in games believe, or fail to believe, about each others’ actions makes a considerable difference to the logic of our analyses, as we will see   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-foundational/
*  As soon as you become satisfied that I have no justification for supposing that there is any kind of probabilistic connection between the character of this line and Fred’s life, you will again reject my claim to have a justified belief about Fred’s impending demise   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ontological/
*  So, likewise, we are able to attain knowledge of God’s existence simply by apprehending that necessary existence is included in the clear and distinct idea of a supremely perfect being   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-global/
*  Philosophers began to reflect on questions such as: Is it ever permissible to engage in coercive military action for humanitarian purposes, such as to halt genocide or prevent large-scale violations of human rights? Can terrorism ever be justified? Should affluent developed countries open their borders more generously than they currently do to those from poor developing countries who would like to immigrate to them? Are our current global economic arrangements fair ones and if not, how should they be transformed? What responsibilities do we have to one another in a globalized, post-Westphalian world order? How should we allocate responsibilities for reducing global injustice in our world, such as in the case of distributing costs associated with addressing climate change? Increased interest concerning issues of global justice has also coincided with enhanced interest in the place and value of nationalism   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/god-necessary-being/
*  Stating the Question The main question we will address in this article is: Does God ground the existence of necessarily existing abstract objects? It is perhaps a more general question than a question one might at first ask: Did God create necessarily existing abstracta? But it is the main question that philosophers who have written about the relation between God and abstract objects have sought to answer   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatic-belief-god/
*  Zagzebski argues that it is rational to try to be moral only if it is rational to believe that the probability that the attempt will succeed and will produce a great good is not outweighed by the probability that one will have to sacrifice goods in the course of the attempt   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/god-ultimates/
*  Moreover, people have thought to conceptualize each of these ultimates in numerous ways across cultures and times, so there are many models of Brahman, many models of God, many models of the Dao, and more; perhaps there is even a model of what is ultimate for each person who has thought hard about it   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-arguments-god/
*  However, it is important to see that there are versions of the moral argument for God’s existence that are completely independent of such a divine command theory, and this possibility can be seen in arguments developed by Angus Ritchie (2012) and Mark Linville (2009)

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger-aesthetics/
* [28] Heidegger expresses this hope that separates him from Hegel in the form of a question: “The truth of Hegel’s judgment has not yet been decided,” he writes, because the question remains: Is art still an essential and a necessary way in which that truth happens which is decisive for our historical existence, or is art this no longer? (PLT 80/GA5 68) Heidegger’s point is that Hegel will no longer be right—the time of great art will no longer be at an end—if contemporary humanity still needs an encounter with art in order to learn how to understand the being of entities in a genuinely post-modern way, and if we still remain capable of such an encounter

*  While embracing the existence of non-genetic inheritance, and its significance for evolutionary accounts, these researchers argue against separating these phenomena into multiple channels or systems of inheritance (Griffiths & Gray 2001): Inheritance phenomena are so intertwined in their effects on development, and each relies on others to have its developmental effect, that it is both more realistic and scientifically more productive not to separate them into distinct channels, systems, or replicator types   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/johann-herbart/
*  That is, as we saw, because the soul (the terms, “psyche” and “soul”, will be used interchangeably in this article) is postulated to be simple and “originally an utter tabula rasa, without any life or thought” (SW VI: 120), the evident multiplicity of conscious representations generates a paradox (PsW: 171)

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hobbes-science/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/imagination/
*  On the one hand, some philosophers have pointed to novel psychological phenomena in which it is unclear whether imagination or belief is at work—such as delusions (Egan 2008a) and immersed pretense (Schellenberg 2013)—and argued that the best explanation for these phenomena says that imagination and belief exists on a continuum

Similarly, if you believe that it is likely or even possible that there is an afterlife where there is great ongoing harm, should we not hope that this not be the case for the villagers? Wielenberg’s comments on the Holocaust are puzzling

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/implicature-optimality-games/
*  Grice has argued, for instance, that the exclusive interpretation of ‘or’—according to which we infer from ‘John or Mary came’ that John and Mary didn’t come both—is not due to the semantic meaning of ‘or’ but should be accounted for by a theory of conversational implicature

For example, why honor the requirement when a fully capacitated Jehovah’s Witness refuses a blood transfusion on religious grounds? Why honor it when health is not at stake, for example, in experiments on stored tissue? Finally, specifically from a utilitarian standpoint, why honor the requirement on occasions when it seems to set back collective health, for example, when we cannot develop a new drug that would help many, because no one is altruistic enough to consent to participate in its risky study? 2

What are such public spaces? Is there any reasonable expectation of privacy in an era of pervasive and ubiquitous surveillance and data tracking? How is confidentiality or anonymity assured online?

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/james-viterbo/
* ” The love of God philosophers have in mind, James contends, is the love of desire; it cannot, by the philosophers’ own admission, be the love of friendship, for according to the Magna Moralia, friendship involves a form of community or sharing between the friends that cannot possibly obtain between mere mortals and the gods   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/introspection/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-philosophy/
*  As will be explained below, in Japan bushidō, the Way of the warrior, is such a philosophical hybrid born of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Shintō, but which became an independent philosophy of its own that in many ways served as a rival to its antecedents

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-aesthetics/
*  It is an extraordinary miracle that you should have escaped to this day; do you suppose you have even the briefest respite in which to relax? (Keene, 120) In the Japanese Buddhist tradition, awareness of the fundamental condition of existence is no cause for nihilistic despair, but rather a call to vital activity in the present moment and to gratitude for another moment’s being granted to us   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionistic-logic-development/
*  But this is no more than apparent; what one is really doing in this case is the following: one starts by constructing a system that fulfills part of the required relations, and tries to deduce from these relations, by means of tautologies, other relations, in such a way that in the end the deduced relations, combined with those that have not yet been used, yield a system of conditions, suitable as a starting-point for the construction of the required system   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nishida-kitaro/
*  It can also be considered an ontology of logical forms for its investigations of their experiential basis, with one qualification: although Nishida proposed a unitary source of such forms, that source is neither exclusionary nor positive; in other words the source itself cannot be described monistically as a single, more basic form or thing

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kyoto-school/
* 3 Members and Associates Ōhashi Ryōsuke’s thesis, advanced already in his landmark German anthology, Die Philosophie der Kyōto-Schule (1990, revised edition 2012; see also Ōhashi and Akitomi 2018), is that the Kyoto School should be understood as a group of thinkers involved in a pluralistic yet cooperative and sustained attempt to think on the basis of an idea of “nothingness” or “absolute nothingness

*  Even as he admits his own devotion to the Academy, John stresses the divide that exists within the School between an extreme skepticism and his own moderate Ciceronian stance, offering a reductio argument against the former: Yet I do not say that all those who are included under the name of Academic have upheld the rule of modesty, since even its basic creed is in dispute and parts of it are open as much to derision as to error… If the Academic is in doubt about each thing, he is certain about nothing… But he possesses uncertainty about whether he is in doubt, so long as he does not know for certain that he does not know this doubt itself

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/jury-theorems/
*  In Condorcet’s (1785) theorem, - the choice problem is binary, like the guilty-or-innocent problem of juries; - the voting procedure is majority voting; - the premises on individuals are competence and independence assumptions of particularly simple kinds; - the conclusion is that “crowds are wise” in the twofold sense that the probability of a correct group decision (i) increases in group size and (ii) converges to one as group size approaches infinity   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-healthcareaccess/
*  How, for example, do we actually tell if access to care is equal or equitable? The problem of measuring access to care aside, we might think that the concept of equal access is straightforwardly analyzed, and the concept of equitable access depends in a more complex way on what inequalities in access are permissible   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-climate/
*  If, for example, one thinks that individuals have human rights to meet their socio-economic needs then this should surely also bear on questions of climate justice too since it provides a reason to combat climate change and a reason to distribute responsibilities so that they do not burden the poor and vulnerable   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-bad-luck/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice/
*  It is a characteristic mark of justice that the obligations it creates should be enforceable: we can be made to deliver what is due to others as a matter of justice, either by the recipients themselves or by third parties   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-distributive/
*  What is the underlying concern, shared by most theorists and the general population, with a society lacking formal equality of opportunity? The concern seems to be rooted in the belief that traits such as a persons’ gender or race are elements over which people have no control and, hence, a society in which people’s race or gender have fundamental effects on their lifetime economic prospects treats people unfairly   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-global/
*  Philosophers began to reflect on questions such as: Is it ever permissible to engage in coercive military action for humanitarian purposes, such as to halt genocide or prevent large-scale violations of human rights? Can terrorism ever be justified? Should affluent developed countries open their borders more generously than they currently do to those from poor developing countries who would like to immigrate to them? Are our current global economic arrangements fair ones and if not, how should they be transformed? What responsibilities do we have to one another in a globalized, post-Westphalian world order? How should we allocate responsibilities for reducing global injustice in our world, such as in the case of distributing costs associated with addressing climate change? Increased interest concerning issues of global justice has also coincided with enhanced interest in the place and value of nationalism   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/territorial-rights/
*  To address this question, the theory needs an argument that relates people and land to the state in ways that justify rights over particular bits of territory, and this is a difficult problem for one of the most prominent theories of territory—justice theories   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-inequality-health/
*  So what makes a health inequality an injustice, when it is one? Do health inequalities have some significance in justice that differs from other important inequalities? Or is the injustice of an unjust inequality in health simply due to the application of general principles of equality and justice to the case of health? To answer these questions, one has to examine two rather different literatures   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-retributive/
* Retributive Justice The concept of retributive justice has been used in a variety of ways, but it is best understood as that form of justice committed to the following three principles: - that those who commit certain kinds of wrongful acts, paradigmatically serious crimes, morally deserve to suffer a proportionate punishment; - that it is intrinsically morally good—good without reference to any other goods that might arise—if some legitimate punisher gives them the punishment they deserve; and - that it is morally impermissible intentionally to punish the innocent or to inflict disproportionately large punishments on wrongdoers   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-virtue/

*  These two premises will lead you, bean by bean, to the conclusion that one, or even no beans, is a heap! It seems that we are a priori justified in believing both the general and the more specific claim are true, but at least one of them must not be true (perhaps the general claim is false, or even neither true nor false) because together they lead to an absurd conclusion   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-foundational/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-intergenerational/
* 2 below, in applying the second notion of harm, we do not have to compare the value of life below some threshold with nonexistence (or with how well off another person or other people would have been) in order to be able to claim that we can cause harm to a person by bringing about that person’s existence

*  The Identity of Indiscernibles The Leibnizian principle that “there are never two things in nature which are exactly alike and in which it is impossible to find a difference that is internal or founded on an intrinsic denomination” is enunciated in the Monadology (G 6: 608), as well as in the Correspondence with Samuel Clarke (G 7: 372)

*  What can we say positively about them? What does it mean that they are not in space and time? How is this claim compatible with the doctrine that we cannot know anything about them? How is the claim that they affect us compatible with that doctrine? Is Kant committed to the existence of things in themselves, or is the concept of a “thing in itself” merely the concept of a way objects might be (for all we know)? - (c) The relation of things in themselves to appearances   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-hume-morality/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-aesthetics/
*  Another is that it raises an interpretive problem which has no analogue in the case of the other Critiques: that is, how to make sense of the work as a whole given the seeming disparity of the two parts, not only with each other, but also with the “faculty of judgment” which is the work's ostensible focus   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-conceptualism/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/
*  The Metaphysics of Morals, for instance, is meant to be based on a priori rational principles, but many of the specific duties that Kant describes, along with some of the arguments he gives in support of them, rely on general facts about human beings and our circumstances that are known from experience

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-spacetime/

*  Correspondingly, a Kantian cognitive faculty is innate in the threefold sense that (i) it is intrinsic to the mind, hence a necessary part of the nature of the rational animal possessing that faculty, (ii) it contains internal structures that are necessarily or strictly underdetermined by any and all sensory impressions and/or empirical facts—which is the same as their being a priori (B2), and (iii) it automatically systematically synthesizes those sensory inputs according to special normative rules that directly reflect the internal structures of the faculty, thereby generating its correlatively-structured outputs

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-acquaindescrip/
*  Contemporary Views on Acquaintance We said above that what distinguishes the classical, Russellian notion of acquaintance is, minimally, that (i) it is a non-intentional form of awareness: acquaintance with something does not consist in forming any judgment or thought about it, or applying any concepts to it; and (ii) it is real relation requiring the existence of its relata; one cannot be acquainted with some thing, property or fact that does not exist

*  So, for example, the thought is that it is a law that all uranium spheres are less than a mile in diameter because it is, arguably, part of the best deductive systems; quantum theory is an excellent theory of our universe and might be part of the best systems, and it is plausible to think that quantum theory plus truths describing the nature of uranium would logically entail that there are no uranium spheres of that size (Loewer 1996, 112)

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-reas-interpret/
*  This being so, for some legal theorists, the first formulation above, that legal reasoning is reasoning about the law, is ambiguous between: (a) reasoning to establish the content of the law as it presently exists, and (b) reasoning from that content to the decision which a court should reach in a case which comes before it

*  The main philosophical problems raised by precedent and analogy are these: (1) when are two cases the ‘same’ for the purposes of precedent? (2) when are two cases ‘similar’ for the purposes of analogy? and (3) in both situations, why should the decision in the earlier case affect the decision in the later case? The study of precedent and analogy is of interest for a number of reasons: - some theorists claim that precedent involves a form of reasoning different to reasoning using rules; - although arguments from precedent are extremely common in many institutional and quasi-institutional settings, not merely the law, there is no consensus on the rational basis for their force, nor indeed on whether such arguments have any rational force; - some theorists argue that the use of analogies in law is not a form of ‘reasoning’ at all; and finally, - even if there is an intelligible form of analogical reasoning, it is unclear why the similarity between two situations provides a reason for treating them both in the same manner   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-probabilism/

If the standard of decision in a murder case is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, how strong should the evidence be to meet this standard? Legal probabilism is a theoretical framework that helps to address these different questions

This point is also emphasized by Leibniz in a 1705 letter to Burnett: “I never write anything in philosophy that I do not treat by definitions and axioms, though I do not always give it that mathematical air, which puts people off, for one must speak in a familiar manner to be read by ordinary people” (G 3:302)

* ] The rules employed in this proof[8] illustrate an aspect of natural deduction that is thought (by some) to be very important in the metatheory of natural deduction: that each connective of the language should have an introduction rule and an elimination rule—or as this is sometimes put, the entire logic should be organized into pairs of Introduction and Elimination (Int-Elim for short) rules for each logical operator

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-provability/
*  The axiom system of propositional provability logic The logical language of propositional provability logic contains, in addition to propositional atoms and the usual truth-functional operators as well as the contradiction symbol \(\bot\), a modal operator \(\Box\) with intended meaning “is provable in \(T\),” where \(T\) is a sufficiently strong formal theory, let us say Peano Arithmetic (see Section 4)

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/settheory-early/
*  The case of Bolzano suggests that a liberation from metric concepts (which came with the development of theories of projective geometry and especially of topology) was to have a crucial role in making possible the abstract viewpoint of set theory   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-modal-origins/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/proof-theory-development/
*  For example, a conjunction used as an assumption can be decomposed into its constituents, as in the rules Gentzen developed and studied the system of natural deduction during 1932, and had arrived by September 1932 at a calculus of natural deduction (ND for short) that is standard today

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-consequence/
*  This constraint is plausibly thought to be a necessary condition for logical consequence (if it could be that the premises are true and the conclusion isn’t, then there is no doubt that the conclusion does not follow from the premises); however, on most accounts of logical consequence, it is not a sufficient condition for validity

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-pluralism/

* ) On what is possibly the oldest way of understanding the logical modality, that modal force is entirely due to this property: thus, for example, on this view to say that (1) must be true can only mean that (1) is a particular case of the true universal generalization “For all suitable \(P\), \(Q\), \(a\) and \(b\), if \(a\) is a \(P\) only if \(b\) is a \(Q\), and \(a\) is a \(P\), then \(b\) is a \(Q\)”

*  What is the significance of the distinction we are making between them in calling one but not the other “logically true”? A principled demarcation of logical constants might offer an answer to this question, thereby clarifying what is at stake in philosophical controversies for which it matters what counts as logic (for example, logicism and structuralism in the philosophy of mathematics)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-normative/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-temporal/
*  As usual, \(V\) is a valuation that assigns to every atomic proposition \(p \in {PROP}\) the set of time instants \(V(p) \subseteq T\) at which \(p\) is considered true, and the truth of an arbitrary formula \(\varphi\) of PBTL at a given time instant \(t\) in a Peircean tree model \(\mathcal{M}\) is defined inductively

At best, panpsychism, under this pretext, is merely an empty and vain idea, “a conception … that, [may be counted] among the dreams of our imagination”; it names a belief about which the most we may say is that it “may be one of those which do not contradict actual facts” (Micro, I, p

*  It was against this background that around this time Luther had his so-called “tower experience”, which like the thunder storm, was later portrayed by Luther as a life-changing moment in a way that may be more myth than fact, and is named after the tower of the monastery in Wittenberg where it is said to have occurred (1532, WA TR 3 no 3232a–c/LW 54:193–4)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/luther-influence/
*  Moreover, as discussed in Luther entry §4, Luther has arguments against free choice that are independent of any commitment to materialism, which rest instead on his claim that there can be no “neutral” normative space for the free will to exercise its choices as Erasmus had claimed: for it is either a good will which will see the good as its only option and so not be faced with any choice, or a bad will which thinks that the bad is also an option it should consider, but then qua will it is always turned away from the good and so has no choice in this direction either

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/malebranche-ideas/
*  But what about our knowledge of other things, especially the self or the mind, or other minds? Why is that sort of knowledge excluded from the doctrine, especially since as a faithful Cartesian dualist he maintains that there are both bodies and minds? Given his theory of divine archetypes for creation, Malebranche must allow that there is an idea of the mind in God, but he does not think God gives us access to this idea   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mally/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/maimonides-islamic/
*  The Theology of Aristotle also introduces two critical insights about creation which one finds too in al-Farabi and Avicenna: - Creation is emanation - God creates/emanates in virtue of His onwmost essential goodness In whatever way one winds up interpreting Maimonides’ own view on creation, it is important to bear in mind that he is writing in a philosophical context in which there is plenty of strong precedent for identifying the language of “creation” (and even “creation ex nihilo”) with the idea that God eternally emanates forth in virtue of his ownmost essence as the pure good (a point itself rooted in Plotinus in the idea of an “unjealous” God in Plato’s Timaeus)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mally-deontic/
*  In the following we will point out three facts: First, if Mally’s deontic principles are added to a system in which the so-called paradoxes of material and strict implication are avoided, many of the “surprising” theorems (such as (34) and (35)) are no longer derivable and A ↔ !A is no longer derivable either (section 8)

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathematics-inconsistent/
*  Given a supposition which seems to be conceivable, namely that whatever happens or is true, happens or is true on an open set of (spacetime) points, one has that the logic of dynamically possible paths is open set logic, that is to say intuitionist logic, which supports incomplete theories par excellence   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathematics-explanation/
*  And since many of the non-causal explanations that have been discussed in the literature are mathematical explanations, this area of philosophy of science is fueled by concerns related to the nature of scientific explanation   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathematics-nondeductive/
*  The reason for this is that the passage from axioms to theorem is straightforward, in principle, since it is a matter of logical derivation

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hilbert-program/
*  For the axioms of geometry, consistency can be proved by providing an interpretation of the system in the real plane, and thus, the consistency of geometry is reduced to the consistency of analysis   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-mathematics/
*  If we take the mathematics that is involved in our best scientific theories at face value, then we appear to be committed to a form of platonism   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fictionalism-mathematics/
*  Fictionalism, on the other hand, is the view that (a) our mathematical sentences and theories do purport to be about abstract mathematical objects, as platonism suggests, but (b) there are no such things as abstract objects, and so (c) our mathematical theories are not true   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathphil-indis/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/formalism-mathematics/
*  Game and Term Formalism Frege does not extract a unified, consistent position from the work of Heine and Thomae, and much of his criticism is devoted to showing that they inconsistently slip into modes of thought which are only appropriate for ‘contentful’ arithmetic, which Frege takes to be a body of truths expressed by utterances in which numerical expressions designate abstract referents independent of the mind (or at least any particular individual’s mind)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionism/

*  On Wittgenstein’s view, we invent mathematical calculi and we expand mathematics by calculation and proof, and though we learn from a proof that a theorem can be derived from axioms by means of certain rules in a particular way, it is not the case that this proof-path pre-exists our construction of it   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meaning-normativity/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meaning-holism/
*  The “belief-focused” and “inference-focused” ways of characterizing use-based holism are often treated as interchangeable,[2] and will be so treated here unless the distinction is particularly relevant in a context,[3] and so for our purposes here, meaning holism will be understood as the following general view: The determinants of the meanings of our terms are interconnected in a way that leads a change in the meaning of any single term to produce a change in the meanings of each of the rest   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/persons-means/

What are the principles of selection at work? What is not being said? The aphoristic form seems to raise some of the same questions about possible esoteric motivations as does the allegorical form

*  For instance Jerome Wakefield (1992, 1996, 2007), writing about psychiatric conditions in particular, notes that a condition should be considered a disease if it both causes harm to the person or otherwise contributes diminished value, and the condition results from some internal mechanism failing to perform its natural function (hence for instance much of what is diagnosed as “depression” would fail to count as a disease condition)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-philosophy/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analogy-medieval/
*  Thus ‘healthy’ was said to be an analogical term when said of a dog and its food because while the dog has health in the primary sense, its food is healthy only secondarily as contributing to or causing the health of the dog   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-mechanisms/
*  The boundaries of a mechanism—what is in the mechanism and what is not—are fixed by reference to the phenomenon that the mechanism explains   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-medieval/
* 1 Motion in General There is a large body of medieval literature which deals with general change of state: it is important because it led to a great deal of careful analysis of continuous change (under the heading of “intension and remission of forms”), and this body of analysis was one of the contributing currents which led to the invention of the calculus in the sixteenth century   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-categories/
*  The intension of a term is the set of properties that apply to the things of which the term is truthfully predicated and which are listed in its definition or taken to be implied by it   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conscience-medieval/
*  Since the first three parts of the soul are potentialities and synderesis is classified alongside these, it seems to follow that it too must be a faculty or power of the soul, distinct from the faculty of reason   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequence-medieval/
* 3) In more mundane terms, the two core aspects that Tarski attributes to the so-called common notion of logical consequence can be formulated as: - (TP) - necessary truth-preservation: it is impossible for the antecedent to be true while the consequent is not true; - (ST) - substitution of terms: the relation of consequence is preserved under any (suitable) substitution of the non-logical terms of the sentences in question; this is now often referred to as the formality criterion   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/demonstration-medieval/
*  These last two requirements were variously interpreted by medieval thinkers, but we can note that Aristotle allows a statement can be per se in two ways: (1) if its subject term somehow includes its predicate within its definition, so that “A human being is rational” is per se, and (2) if its predicate term includes its subject implicitly in its definition as the proper subject for that sort of accident, so that “A human being is able to laugh” is per se (PA I 4, 73a35-b24   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-emotions/
*  While the Stoics, following their reason-centered rationalist psychology, argued that it is philosophically sufficient to treat emotions simply as mistaken value-judgments, it was more common in ancient and medieval times to follow the view of Plato and Aristotle, who distinguished between the non-emotional intellectual power and the lower emotional parts of the soul, which were eliminated by the Stoics   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-futcont/
*  The second interpretation insists that Aristotle’s point is not to deny the truth-value of these statements, but their being true in the same way as other statements are true   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-haecceity/
*  Explaining both divisibility and its opposite, Scotus states the problem of individuation as follows: Because there is among beings something indivisible into subjective parts – that is, such that it is formally incompatible for it to be divided into several parts each of which is it – the question is not what it is by which such a division is formally incompatible with it (because it is formally incompatible by incompatibility), but rather what it is by which, as by a proximate and intrinsic foundation, this incompatibility is in it   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/representation-medieval/

*  His treatment of the prudence as a virtue with both intellectual and moral components, his acceptance of universal moral principles in the natural law, and his understanding of practical reason and its relation to human happiness had a profound effect upon the writings of his student, Thomas Aquinas   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-terms/
*  It is generally agreed that its early stages were closely bound up with the theory of fallacies, but as a general semantic theory, it developed in response to a variety of needs, and one mistake of modern attempts at interpretation is to seek a unique rationale of one notion or another   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relations-medieval/
*  After this point, there is a noticeable shift away from the Categories paradigm, with the result that many philosophers come to regard those situations in which substances are related by virtue of their accidents as the exception rather than the rule   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/singular-terms-medieval/
*  First, the meaning of a term is not an entity to which the term is related in some way, but one can say that an utterance signifies or makes known an entity, whether conceptual or real, universal or particular   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-syllogism/
*  In the first figure he gives these rules (I have included the terms A, B, C to clarify the rules, though they are not in Abelard’s text): - (4:1) - If something A is predicated of something else B universally and a third thing C places the subject B under it universally, then the same thing C also places the predicate A under it with the same mode, namely universally   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentals-medieval/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-causal/
*  To put the matter less technically, one might say that causal theories of mental content presuppose that it is possible for a purely physical system to bear underived content   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-externalism/
*  A planet is individuation dependent on a star around which it orbits in the sense that without this star, and resulting orbit, it would not be a planet but some other kind of celestial object   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-causation/
*  So is it in fact the case that working scientists, and in particular, psychologists, find it necessary to appeal to distinctively mental phenomena to account for behavior? Is there evidence in neuroscience that mental states and processes figure in the production of actions? Although most psychologists would without hesitation accept the causal interaction of minds and bodies, a small but growing number of empirical researchers have insisted that the evidence supports some version of epiphenomenalism, the thesis that mental states, while caused by physical happenings, exert no efficacy in return   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-narrow/
*  Similarly, a narrow content of a belief or other mental state is a content that could not be different unless the subject who has the state were different in some intrinsic respect: no matter how different the individual's environment were, the belief would have the same content it actually does   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-nonconceptual/
*  A state-type is concept-dependent just if it is content-bearing and it is impossible for a thinking and perceiving subject to be in a token state of that type without possessing the concepts required to specify the content of that token state   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-teleological/
*  However, the problem is that crumpled paper is included in the extension as soon as it causes a CAT to be tokened and so, on this theory, there is no logical space for the possibility of error since candidate errors are transformed into non-errors by their very occurrence

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mereology-medieval/
*  The primary purpose of division for Late Ancient philosophers is to determine the hierarchical relations between a universal and that which falls under it   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mereology/
*  For example, it is satisfied by a model in which a whole can be decomposed into several proper parts all of which overlap one another (Figure 2, right), and it may be argued that such models do not do justice to the meaning of ‘proper part’: after all, the idea is that the removal of a proper part should leave a remainder, but it is by no means clear what would be left of x once z (along with its parts) is removed   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/location-mereology/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mersenne/
*  Mersenne often pointed out the connection between Protestantism and the various forms of heterodoxy and atheism: the Calvinist belief in predestination insensibly drives men toward superstition and atheism, as it appears more difficult to believe that God wants our damnation, than to represent Him as a “cruel Saturn who devours his children”, or simply to own that there is no God at all (ID II: 589)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaethics/
*  As such, it counts within its domain a broad range of questions and puzzles, including: Is morality more a matter of taste than truth? Are moral standards culturally relative? Are there moral facts? If there are moral facts, what is their origin? How is it that they set an appropriate standard for our behavior? How might moral facts be related to other facts (about psychology, happiness, human conventions…)? And how do we learn about the moral facts, if there are any? These questions lead naturally to puzzles about the meaning of moral claims as well as about moral truth and the justification of our moral commitments   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/suarez/
*  The second topic (DM II–XI) treats transcendental terms, including being (ens), but also good (bonum) and true (veritas), which are transcendental in the sense that they may be predicated of beings in any category (a quality is a being, an ens, just as a substance is an ens, and so on for every category of being)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-mexico/
*  Likewise, it is often claimed that philosophy in Mexico is not the same as Mexican philosophy, and that while philosophy in Mexico has a long and distinguished history, it is wrong to speak of Mexican philosophy, defined by the originality or authenticity of its debates or theses, the distinctness of its schools, or the uniqueness of its style or terminology (see Romanell 1975)

* ] (3) Sometimes the expression of P by means of W would manifestly violate some particular maxim if P and P alone were what S was out to get across, but the natural inference is that what she was out to get across was P and then some: the expression of P by means of W readily calls to mind some unique more inclusive story Q about the world of which P forms an essential part, such that S might plausibly be in a position to vouch for Q’s truth and such that doing so by means of W, if it could be managed, might plausibly comply with all the maxims

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/holism-social/
*  Within these discussions, holism is the view that social phenomena exist sui generis, or in their own right (the ontological debate); that social scientific explanations need not always be confirmed by looking at what happens at the level of individuals (the debate on confirmation); and that moral responsibility may sometimes be ascribed to social phenomena such as groups (one version of the moral debate)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/microbiology/
*  Many biologists and philosophers remain unpersuaded by the Gaia hypothesis (see Resnik 1992; Pigliucci 2014); nevertheless, it is worthy of mention as an instance in which the versatility, abundance, minuteness and pervasiveness of microbes lead to them being given a powerful ecological status for their roles in determining the way life works on Earth   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mind-identity/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/modularity-mind/
*  A cognitive system is informationally encapsulated to the extent that in the course of processing a given set of inputs it cannot access information stored elsewhere; all it has to go on is the information contained in those inputs plus whatever information might be stored within the system itself, for example, in a proprietary database

*  Paley does not cast his own argument into a deductive form, but he does attempt to forestall this sort of criticism by adding, in rounding out Part 1, an additional claim for which he offers several lines of argument: [T]here is not satisfactory evidence, that persons professing to be original witnesses of other miracles, in their nature as certain as these are, have ever acted in the same manner, in attestation of the accounts which they delivered, and properly in consequence of their belief of those accounts   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-modal/
*  Most of us are inclined to affirm that what we know best we know through the senses, along with the other falsities already mentioned, but in addition: our conceptions of mind and God represent mind and God as sensible when they are not; we think and speak by way of terms that we do not understand or that may have no corresponding idea; and what we take to be the paradigm of a distinct perception is hardly distinct at all

*  After all, this is the philosopher who claims that “in nature there is nothing contingent, but all things have been determined from the necessity of the divine nature to exist and produce an effect in a certain way” (Ip29) and that “things could have been produced by God in no other way, and in no other order than they have been produced” (Ip33)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/modality-varieties/
*  On this account, a proposition \(P\) is epistemically necessary for \(A\) just in case \(P\) is true in all possible worlds that cannot be ruled out on the basis of \(A\)’s empirical evidence and ideal reasoning   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/model-theory/
*  Another way of saying that \(I\) is a model of \(S\) is to say that \(S\) is true in \(I\), and so we have the notion of model-theoretic truth, which is truth in a particular interpretation

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/
*  Even if, from an ontological point of view, anything can be a model and the class of things that are referred to as models contains a heterogeneous collection of different things, it does not follow that it is either impossible or pointless to develop an ontology of models

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-definition/
*  If one uses “morality” in its descriptive sense, and therefore uses it to refer to codes of conduct actually put forward by distinct groups or societies, one will almost certainly deny that there is a universal morality that applies to all human beings   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-epistemology-a-priori/
*  If one wants to think in terms of special propositions, there will be propositions that are special only in an attenuated sense: it is possible for a person to have the experience of seeing the propositions to be true simply by understanding and thinking about them   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-motivation/
*  When we make the normative judgment that something is good for us, or that we have a reason to act in a particular way, or that a specific course of action is the rational course, we also tend to be moved   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-luck/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-realism/
*  The debate between moral realists and anti-realists assumes, though, that there is a shared object of inquiry—in this case, a range of claims all involved are willing to recognize as moral claims—about which two questions can be raised and answered: Do these claims purport to report facts in light of which they are true or false? Are some of them true? Moral realists answer ‘yes’ to both, non-cognitivists answer ‘no’ to the first (and, by default, ‘no’ to the second) while error theorists answer ‘yes’ to the first and ‘no’ to the second   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-biology/
*  The above sorts of questions, which are receiving growing attention in the sciences, all pertain to morality understood as a set of empirical phenomena to be explained: it is an empirical fact about human beings that we make moral judgments, have certain feelings and behave in certain ways, and it is natural for the sciences to seek causal explanations for such phenomena   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-particularism-generalism/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-phenomenology/
*  Used in this way, one may, for instance, focus on the what-it’s-likeness of a sharp pain one is currently experiencing and perhaps attempt to describe the subjective character of that pain—its phenomenology   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-psych-emp/
*  The plausibility of its associated moral psychology is not, of course, the only dimension on which an ethical theory may be evaluated; equally important are normative questions having to do with how well a theory fares when compared to important convictions about such things as justice, fairness, and the good life   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasoning-moral/
*  On such a footing, it is possible to launch powerful arguments against the claim that moral principles undergird every moral truth (Dancy 1993) and for the claim that we can sometimes perfectly well decide what to do by acting on the reasons we perceive instinctively – or as we have been trained – without engaging in any moral reasoning   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-relativism/
*  Most often it is associated with an empirical thesis that there are deep and widespread moral disagreements and a metaethical thesis that the truth or justification of moral judgments is not absolute, but relative to the moral standard of some person or group of persons   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism-moral/
*  Skepticism about moral truth-value is the claim that no substantive moral belief is either true or false (although some moral beliefs are the kind of thing that could be true or false)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-animal/
*  The most common way of understanding it is to suggest that there are distinctly human capacities and it is on the basis of these capacities that humans have moral status and other animals do not   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-responsibility-epistemic/
* ) The lesson, then, is that for an agent to be directly blameworthy for an action—that is, blameworthy in a way that doesn’t derive from previous instances of blameworthiness, such as culpability for the ignorance from which she acts—she must be aware that she is performing the action in question, and be aware of it under an appropriate description (Anscombe 1963; Levy 2014: 37)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-responsibility/
*  One way of getting at this incompatibilist worry is to focus on the way in which performance of a given action should be up to an agent if he has the sort of free will required for moral responsibility   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-more/
*  More's outlook was shaped by his legal role in the affairs of the city, then by far the largest in England with a population of about 50,000, and it was as a representative of city interests that he was first drawn into service of the Crown   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/grounds-moral-status/
*  By contrast, constructing plausible theories that account for the moral status of other human beings – not only the degree of their status, but in some cases also whether they have it at all – is more challenging (see section 5)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-sentimentalism/
*  On this picture, in contrast to Shaftesbury, the motive of morally praiseworthy actions is benevolence and not the thought that the action is obligatory or that it would be approved of by the moral sense itself   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/henry-more/
*  More’s motive in promoting this theology was not to solve the so-called “problem of evil” (why God allows so much suffering in the world), as it was later for Leibniz (and Dr Pangloss), but to ensure that God created a world which was (according to More at least) most capable of establishing the Creator’s own existence   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/alternative-possibilities/
*  On the other hand, if talk of ultimacy is intended to signal a higher grade of responsibility, there will be a corresponding version of our principle to be evaluated on its own terms: PAP-ultimate: a person is ultimately morally responsible for what she has done only if she could have done otherwise   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-motivation/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiculturalism/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hist-westphilmusic-since-1800/
*  However, it is worth noting that the rejection of language as a model for the understanding of music is a move that allows us to look at music as a symbol in its own right, with its own syntactic and semantic rules   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mysticism/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lawphil-theory/
*  But then, of course, the question is why certain acts or events have such a legal meaning and others don’t? Kelsen’s answer to this question is surprisingly simple: an act or an event gains its legal-normative meaning by another legal norm that confers this normative meaning on it   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/law-interpretivist/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/god-necessary-being/
*  Stating the Question The main question we will address in this article is: Does God ground the existence of necessarily existing abstract objects? It is perhaps a more general question than a question one might at first ask: Did God create necessarily existing abstracta? But it is the main question that philosophers who have written about the relation between God and abstract objects have sought to answer   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/needs/
*  On the other side stand philosophers who argue that needs are a false currency; they appear to be both objective and fundamental, but in fact are neither, since claims of need always make tacit reference to some further end for which the thing claimed is necessary (Barry 1965, 47–9; Flew 1981, ch

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/newton-principia/
*  The key step in developing this answer is a generalization of uniform circular motion to the case of motion under a “centripetal” force — a term Newton coined from Huygens's “centrifugal” force, by which he meant the tension in the string keeping the body in a circle; and a key to this step was the discovery that a body moving under any form of centripetal force always sweeps out equal areas in equal times with respect to that center, so that the appropriate geometrical representation of time for generalizing uniform circular motion is area swept out rather than angle or arc length

* 1 Ancient and Early Modern Debates on the Sources of Social Entities Ancient inquiries into the nature of social phenomena introduced questions that remain active today: Which features of the world are products of humans or society, and which are products of nature? What does it mean to say that something is a social creation? A central concern of Sophism, a school of Greek philosophy in the fifth century BCE, was the contrast between nature (phusis) and custom, law, habit, or convention (nomos)

Suppose that we had imagined a collection of ten apples lined up; then there is indeed another apple between the sixth and eighth, but there is none between the seventh and eighth! On the assumption that Zeno is not simply confused, what does he have in mind? The texts do not say, but here are two possibilities: first, one might hold that for any pair of physical objects (two apples say) to be two distinct objects and not just one (a ‘double-apple’) there must be a third between them, physically separating them, even if it is just air

Or does their disagreement reflect different views about the legitimacy of the application in question? While it is clear that for some to characterize a policy as paternalistic is to condemn or criticize it, that does not establish that the term itself is an evaluative one

*  Since he does not himself affirm anything in any of his dialogues, can we ever be on secure ground in attributing a philosophical doctrine to him (as opposed to one of his characters)? Did he himself have philosophical convictions, and can we discover what they were? Are we justified in speaking of “the philosophy of Plato”? Or, if we attribute some view to Plato himself, are we being unfaithful to the spirit in which he intended the dialogues to be read? Is his whole point, in refraining from writing treatises, to discourage the readers of his works from asking what their author believes and to encourage them instead simply to consider the plausibility or implausibility of what his characters are saying? Is that why Plato wrote dialogues? If not for this reason, then what was his purpose in refraining from addressing his audience in a more direct way? There are other important questions about the particular shape his dialogues take: for example, why does Socrates play such a prominent role in so many of them, and why, in some of these works, does Socrates play a smaller role, or none at all? Once these questions are raised and their difficulty acknowledged, it is tempting, in reading Plato's works and reflecting upon them, to adopt a strategy of extreme caution

*  Then, because Socrates wants not only to show that it is always better to be just but also to convince Glaucon and Adeimantus of this point, and because Socrates’ proofs are opposed by the teachings of poets, he bolsters his case in Book Ten by indicting the poets’ claims to represent the truth and by offering a new myth that is consonant with his proofs

*  The Stranger restates the six definitions of the sophist (Sophist 231c–e), and then observes: Do you know that, when someone appears to know many things, and is called by the name of one art, this appearance (phantasma) is not sound, but it is clear that the person experiencing it in relation to some art is unable to see that [feature] of it toward which all these sorts of learning look, and so he addresses the person having them by many names rather than one? (Sophist 232a) The Stranger has defined the sophist as a hired hunter of rich young men, as engaged in selling his own and other people’s wares for the soul, as an expert in disputation about justice and injustice, and so on   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-myths/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religious-pluralism/
*  Specifically, our discussion will focus primarily on the following questions: How pervasive is religious diversity? Does the reality of this diversity require a response? Can a person who acknowledges religious diversity remain justified in claiming just one perspective to be correct? If so, is it morally justifiable to attempt to convert others to a different perspective? Can it justifiably be claimed that only one religion offers a path into the eternal presence of God? How should religious diversity be approached in public education? The answers to such questions are not simply academic; they have practical implications

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/poincare/
*  It can be argued that Poincaré is justified in including his analysis of arithmetic in Science and Hypothesis, that is, in his analysis of empirical science, given that there is a striking similarity between the role played by the principle of mathematical induction and the principle of induction in natural science, which “is as difficult to justify […] as it is to get along without it” (1905b: 176; 1913b: 345)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/political-obligation/
*  How does one acquire such an obligation, and how many people have really done what is necessary to acquire it? Or is a political obligation more a matter of being than of doing – that is, of simply being a member of the country or state in question? To those questions many answers have been given, and none now commands widespread assent   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ancient-political/
*  While one influential approach to the history of political thought takes its bearings from what a thinker was trying to do in and by what he or she said or wrote, it is important to recognize that the founders of ancient political philosophy were in part trying to define a new space of doing as philosophizing, independent of ordinary political action   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism-intl-relations/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/della-porta/
*  This does not mean that Porta and his contemporaries considered the human imagination as a secondary, harmless entity: quite the contrary was true, as this mental faculty with the power to produce images had somatic effects not only on the body and mind of the individual, but these effects could be passed on—again a set of ideas Porta shares with the Renaissance Neoplatonic Tradition as well as for instance Pietro Pomponazzi’s psychological explanations of the miraculous (Copenhaver 2007, Kodera 2018)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/port-royal-logic/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/postmodernism/
*  The modern public, in contrast to ancient and medieval communities, is a creation of the press, which is the only instrument capable of holding together the mass of unreal individuals “who never are and never can be united in an actual situation or organization” (Kierkegaard 1846, 60)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/possible-worlds/
*  On the assumption that there is a (nonempty) set of all possible worlds and a set of all possible individuals, we can define “objective” notions of truth at a world and of truth simpliciter, that is, notions that are not simply relative to formal, mathematical interpretations but, rather, correspond to objective reality in all its modal glory   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/francois-barre/
*  (T1en 174; TTfr 116–117) Poulain does not seem to reduce knowledge of morality to knowledge of physics, but he emphasizes that there is a methodological unity, which makes it possible to compare the way in which true principles are applied in the natural and the social sciences   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/practical-reason/
*  What do we need to assume—both about agents and about the processes of reasoning they engage in—to make sense of the fact that deliberative reflection can directly give rise to action? Can we do justice to this dimension of practical reason while preserving the idea that practical deliberation is genuinely a form of reasoning? Second, there are large issues concerning the content of the standards that are brought to bear in practical reasoning   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/practical-reason-med/
*  His treatment of the prudence as a virtue with both intellectual and moral components, his acceptance of universal moral principles in the natural law, and his understanding of practical reason and its relation to human happiness had a profound effect upon the writings of his student, Thomas Aquinas   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/innateness-language/
*  To the extent that philosophers before the 20th century dealt with language acquisition at all, they tended to see it as a product of our general ability to reason — an ability that makes us special, and that sets us apart from other animals, but that is not tailored for language learning in particular   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/practical-reason-action/
*  For attribution to be contentful, there must be a real distinction between your actions, on the one hand, and events that resemble actions but are produced by your psychic parts, on the other; we can make out such a distinction only if you identify with a principle of choice, where that is universal in form   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatic-belief-god/
*  Zagzebski argues that it is rational to try to be moral only if it is rational to believe that the probability that the attempt will succeed and will produce a great good is not outweighed by the probability that one will have to sacrifice goods in the course of the attempt   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/defaults-semantics-pragmatics/
*  Next, some, following Grice, consider such pragmatic contributions to utterance meaning to be generalized conversational implicatures (Levinson), others classify them as pragmatic input to what is said, albeit using a variety of theory-specific labels (Recanati, Carston), reserving the term ‘implicature’ for meanings that can be represented by a separate logical form and that function independently from the content of the main utterance in reasoning   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/petitionary-prayer/
*  If you pray to God for rain tomorrow and it does rain tomorrow, this all by itself is not enough to say that your prayer for rain was effective—it must also be the case that God actually brought about the rain at least in part because of your prayer   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/
*  It is important that, as Peirce hints here, the consequences we are concerned with are general and intelligible: we are to look for laws that govern the behaviour of hard things and show how such modes of behaviour can make a difference to what is rational for us to do   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatics/
*  According to Searle’s analysis, for an utterance by S to H to count as a promise must meet the following conditions: - The propositional content represents some future action A by S; - H prefers S’s doing A to her not doing it, and S believes that to be so; and it is not obvious both to S and H that S will do A in the normal course of events; - S intends to do A; and - Promising counts as the undertaking of an obligation of S to do A

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epigenesis/
*  Does every individual start from material that is unformed, and the form emerges only gradually, over time? Or does the individual start in some already preformed, or predelineated, or predetermined way? The questions are part metaphysical: what is it that exists — form or also the unformed that becomes the formed? And they are partly epistemological: how do we know — through observation or inference? The debate has persisted since ancient times, and today plays out as genetic determinists appeal to the already “formed” through genetic inheritance, while others insist on the efficacy of environmental plasticity

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/eugenics/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/presocratics/
*  Hesiod’s world, like Homer’s, is one that is god-saturated, where the gods may intervene in all aspects of the world, from the weather to mundane particulars of human life, acting on the ordinary world order, in a way that humans, limited as they are by time, location, and narrow powers of perception, must accept but cannot ultimately understand

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pm-notation/
*  This makes it appropriate to use the following contextual definition, which allows one to eliminate the class term \(\hat{x} \psi x\) from occurrences in the context \(f\): \[ \tag*{∗20·01} f\{ \hat{z}(\psi z)\} \ldot {=} \colon (\exists \phi) \colon \phi \bang x \ldot {\equiv_x} \ldot \psi x \colon f \{ \phi\bang \hat{z}\} \quad\Df \] or in modern notation: \[ f\{z \mid \psi z\} =_\mathit{df} \exists \phi[\forall x(\phi x \equiv \psi x) \amp f(\lambda x \phi x)] \] where \(\phi\) is a predicative function of \(x\) Note that \(f\) has to be interpreted as a higher-order function which is predicated of the function \(\phi \bang \hat{z}\)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/it-privacy/
* 2 Accounts of the value of privacy The debates about privacy are almost always revolving around new technology, ranging from genetics and the extensive study of bio-markers, brain imaging, drones, wearable sensors and sensor networks, social media, smart phones, closed circuit television, to government cybersecurity programs, direct marketing, RFID tags, Big Data, head-mounted displays and search engines

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/probability-medieval-renaissance/
*  That said, it should nevertheless be kept in mind that medieval discussions of the use of probable opinions predominantly operated on the basis of the second meaning of opinio as a proposition to which assent was given and which was accompanied by a fear that the opposite might be true

*  For example, Sarah Conly argues that the interests that ground a right to procreate can be satisfied with only one child and so it may be permissible to restrict the number of children an individual creates when costs to third parties from overpopulation are substantial (Conly 2005, 2016; see also Statman 2005)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/promises/
*  Promises and Promissory Obligations For ethical theorists the central task is an explanation of promissory obligations: How is it that we come to have a moral obligation to do what we promise we will? The question is particularly difficult because promissory obligations differ from other sorts of moral obligations in a number of ways

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/essential-accidental/
*  The Modal Characterization of the Essential/Accidental Property Distinction According to the basic modal characterization of the distinction between essential and accidental properties, which is the characterization given at the outset, \(P\) is an essential property of an object \(o\) just in case it is necessary that \(o\) has \(P\), whereas \(P\) is an accidental property of an object \(o\) just in case \(o\) has \(P\) but it is possible that \(o\) lacks \(P\)

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/
*  For example, the appeal to gaps is pointless: \(F\) has a gap whether or not it is filled by \(a\) (for example, it could be filled in by another object), and thus the gap cannot explain the fact that \(a\) has \(F\) as one of its properties   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/natural-properties/
*  The tenth-century logician Udayana lists six “impediments” which can be used to show that a word does not stand for a jāti: for example, no two jāti are coextensive, and if two jāti share an instance, then one is such that every instance of it is also an instance of the other   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/proof-theory/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-dionysius-areopagite/
*  Reading Dionysius’ Works Reading Dionysius can be a difficult business for many reasons: partly because his frequent hyperbolic theological language is foreign to our own English-speaking practices; partly because almost every word he employs resonates with the whole history of ancient thought, from the Christian Platonism of the Fathers, particularly, Gregory of Nyssa and the Cappadocians, to the Neoplatonism of Plotinus, Iamblichus, and Proclus, while his theology focuses predominantly upon the Jewish and Christian scriptures (which Dionysius calls “divine oracles”); partly, again, because the order in which we are to read his works is unclear and because Dionysius mentions at least seven works that have been lost

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/public-goods/
*  As we will see in Section 1, the economic definition of a public good has little to do with whether these goods are provided by the public or by private enterprises but with certain abstract features that are shared by many different goods, only some of which are regularly produced publicly   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/providence-divine/
*  To get that result we have to add a crucial premise to the argument put forth by opponents of theism: that there can be no justification for evil, no good reason why a God with the attributes in question would create a world that contained it   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pyrrho/
*  But on the metaphysical reading, too, we have already been told that our sensations and opinions are not true, which is presumably reason enough for us not to trust them; and the unopinionated attitude that is here recommended may be understood as one in which one refrains from positing any definite characteristics as inherent in the nature of things—given that their real nature is wholly indefinite   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/public-reason/
*  How, then, can some moral or political rules be rightly imposed on all of us, particularly if we assume deep and permanent disagreement amongst persons about matters of value, morality, religion, and the good life? The answer, for proponents of public reason, is that such rules can rightly be imposed on persons when the rules can be justified by appeal to ideas or arguments that those persons, at some level of idealization, endorse or accept

*  Because these differences frequently co-travel with indices of disadvantage and power, and because health is viewed by many as a core dimension of human welfare or flourishing, some frame the foundation or justification of public health in terms of fairness and justice – much in the way that significant disparities in resources or liberties are generally framed   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pythagoras/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/publicity/
*  So long as the set of such legitimate bases for denial is publicly discussed and procedural checks are in place, there is no reason to believe that publicizing such a maxim will be self-frustrating in the presence of a real public, nor that such a maxim should be rejected by an ideal public

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-everett/
*  Rather, what it meant for pure wave mechanics to be empirically faithful with respect to the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics is that one can find the standard quantum statistics we experience in the distribution of a typical relative relative sequence of a modeled observer’s measurement records   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-copenhagen/
*  - Rutherford pointed out that if, as Bohr did, one postulates that the frequency of light ν, which an electron emits in a transition, depends on the difference between the initial energy level and the final energy level, it appears as if the electron must “know” to what final energy level it is heading in order to emit light with the right frequency   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-modal/
*  The origin of the modal approach In traditional approaches to quantum measurement theory a central role is played by the projection postulate, which asserts that upon measurement the state of a physical system undergoes a discontinuous change: it is projected (“collapses”) onto an eigenstate corresponding to the measurement result   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kochen-specker/
*  In opposition to von Neumann, the Gleason-type argument derives restrictions on value assignments like (3) only for sets of compatible observables; but still one and the same observable can be a member of different commuting sets, and it is essential to the arguments that the observable gets assigned the same value in both sets, i   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/
*  The existence of the other worlds makes it possible to remove randomness and action at a distance from quantum theory and thus from all physics   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-bohm/
*  But if these entities are not somehow identified with the wave function itself—and if talk of them is not merely shorthand for elaborate statements about measurements—then where are they to be found in the quantum description? There is, perhaps, a very simple reason why it is so difficult to discern in the quantum description the objects we believe quantum mechanics ought to describe   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-consistent-histories/
*  But if this same \(\rho\) is used as a pre-probability for some other sample space, and if one ignores the single framework rule, it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that \([\psi]\) and some other incompatible property corresponding to a projector that does not commute with \([\psi]\) can both be true, which makes no sense   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quantum-bayesian/
*  To get an idea of the kinds of experience and act the QBist has in mind it is helpful to think of the possible outcomes of a quantum measurement on a physical system   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quantification/
*  Fortunately, there is an elegant argument due to Georg Kreisel (1967), which tells us that we can safely restrict attention to set-based models for the specification of the set of validities of pure quantificational logic: a formula \(A\) of the language of quantificational logic is true under every interpretation of the language if, and only if, it is true in every model   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-idind/
*  However, it has also been argued that quantum physics is in fact compatible with a metaphysics of individual objects, but that such objects are indistinguishable in a sense which leads to the violation of Leibniz’s famous Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bell-theorem/
*  Is it possible to have a theory on which the outcome of an experiment performed in some spatial region \(A\) is determined by the complete state of a system in a way that does not depend on the disposition of experimental apparatus at a distance from \(A\)? Bell’s article ends with a brief exposition of the Bohm theory, noting in particular the feature that “in this theory an explicit causal mechanism exists whereby the disposition of one piece of apparatus affects the results obtained with a distant piece” (Bell 1966, 452; 1987b and 2004, 11)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-epr/
*  With these terms in place it is easy to show that if, say, the values of position and momentum for a quantum system were definite (were elements of reality) then the description provided by the wave function of the system would be incomplete, since no wave function contains counterparts for both elements   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-nvd/
*  In the preface to von Neumann’s (1955) treatise on that topic, he notes that Dirac provides a very elegant and powerful formal framework for quantum mechanics, but complains about the central role in that framework of an “improper function with self-contradictory properties,” which he also characterizes as a “mathematical fiction   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-retrocausality/
*  Thus, given Costa de Beauregard’s suggestion of “zigzag” causal influences, it is perfectly possible for a retrocausal model of quantum phenomena to be nonlocal in the sense that causal relations exist between spacelike separated events, but “local” in the sense that these causal influences are mediated by timelike trajectories   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-action-distance/
* ) The state λ is typically thought of as the pair's state at the emission time, and it is assumed that this state does not change in any relevant sense between the emission and the first measurement   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-issues/
*  This gives rise to what has been called the “eigenstate-eigenvalue link”, that is, the interpretative principle that, if a system is assigned a state vector that is an eigenvector of some operator representing a physical quantity, then the corresponding dynamical quantity has the corresponding value, and this can be regarded as a property of the physical system   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-entangle/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/
*  Finally, there is the idea suggested by Beck and Eccles in the 1990s, according to which quantum mechanical processes, relevant for the description of exocytosis at the synaptic cleft, can be influenced by mental intentions   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/
*  If instead we assume that quantum mechanics is itself applicable to the description of measurements, then the question becomes one of how one should model a measurement within quantum theory, specifically as some appropriate interaction between a ‘system’ and an ‘apparatus’, and of whether by so doing one can derive from the unitary evolution for the total system of system and apparatus the three phenomenological aspects of quantum measurements: that measurements have results, that these results obtain with some characteristic probabilities, and that depending on the result of a measurement the state of the system is generally transformed in a characteristic way (for this subdivision of the problem, see Maudlin 1995)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-quantcomp/
*  Note, however, that all these models are based on classical physics, hence the unavoidable question: Can the shift to quantum physics allow us to find “short-cuts” in computational resources? The quest for the quantum computer began with the possibility of giving a positive answer to this question   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quantum-field-theory/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/questions/
*  Bromberger (1966, 105) argues that (22) does not count as a correct answer to (21) on his theory in part because the following is not an abnormic law: - (23) No pole that is straight and perpendicular to the ground is 40 feet high unless there is a 50 foot wire that is tautly stretched between the top of the pole and a point 30 feet from the base of the pole   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quantum-gravity/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/race/
* Race The concept of race has historically signified the division of humanity into a small number of groups based upon five criteria: (1) Races reflect some type of biological foundation, be it Aristotelian essences or modern genes; (2) This biological foundation generates discrete racial groupings, such that all and only all members of one race share a set of biological characteristics that are not shared by members of other races; (3) This biological foundation is inherited from generation to generation, allowing observers to identify an individual’s race through her ancestry or genealogy; (4) Genealogical investigation should identify each race’s geographic origin, typically in Africa, Europe, Asia, or North and South America; and (5) This inherited racial biological foundation manifests itself primarily in physical phenotypes, such as skin color, eye shape, hair texture, and bone structure, and perhaps also behavioral phenotypes, such as intelligence or delinquency   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-quantlog/
* 1 Quantum Probability in a Nutshell The quantum-probabilistic formalism, as developed by von Neumann [1932], assumes that each physical system is associated with a (separable) Hilbert space \(\mathbf{H}\), the unit vectors of which correspond to possible physical states of the system   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottish-18th/
*  As regards Hobbes, Hutcheson thought his doctrine was both wrong and dangerous; wrong because by the frame of our nature we have compassionate, generous and benevolent affections which owe nothing at all to calculations of self-interest, and dangerous because people may be discouraged from the morally worthy exercise of cultivating generous affections in themselves on the grounds that the exercise of such affections is really an exercise in dissimulation or pretence   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ramsey-economics/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-bayesian/
*  It acquires epistemological significance only in conjunction with a further epistemological assumption: Simple Principle of Conditionalization: If one begins with initial or prior probabilities Pi, and one acquires new evidence which can be represented as becoming certain of an evidentiary statement E (assumed to state the totality of one's new evidence and to have initial probability greater than zero), then rationality requires that one systematically transform one's initial probabilities to generate final or posterior probabilities Pf by conditionalizing on E — that is: Where S is any statement, Pf(S) = Pi(S/E)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-realism/
*  The debate between moral realists and anti-realists assumes, though, that there is a shared object of inquiry—in this case, a range of claims all involved are willing to recognize as moral claims—about which two questions can be raised and answered: Do these claims purport to report facts in light of which they are true or false? Are some of them true? Moral realists answer ‘yes’ to both, non-cognitivists answer ‘no’ to the first (and, by default, ‘no’ to the second) while error theorists answer ‘yes’ to the first and ‘no’ to the second   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationality-normative-utility/

*  For if there can be a single-case chance of \(\frac{1}{2}\) for a coin to land heads on a toss even if there is only one actual toss, and it lands tails, then surely the chance cannot be fixed by properties of the outcome ‘lands heads’, as that outcome does not exist   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism/
*  In general, where the distinctive objects of a subject-matter are a, b, c, … , and the distinctive properties are F-ness, G-ness, H-ness and so on, realism about that subject matter will typically take the form of a claim like the following: Generic Realism: a, b, and c and so on exist, and the fact that they exist and have properties such as F-ness, G-ness, and H-ness is (apart from mundane empirical dependencies of the sort sometimes encountered in everyday life) independent of anyone’s beliefs, linguistic practices, conceptual schemes, and so on   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism-intl-relations/
*  Nevertheless, if the History is described as the only acknowledged classical text in international relations, and if it inspires theorists from Hobbes to contemporary international relations scholars, this is because it is more than a chronicle of events, and a theoretical position can be extrapolated from it   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/
*  In light of the diversity within a democracy, what would it mean for citizens legitimately to exercise coercive political power over one another? Rawls’s test for the acceptable use of political power in a democracy is his liberal principle of legitimacy: Our exercise of political power is fully proper only when it is exercised in accordance with a constitution the essentials of which all citizens as free and equal may reasonably be expected to endorse in the light of principles and ideals acceptable to their common human reason (PL, 137)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bounded-rationality/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism-sem-challenge/
*  These are: - Dummett’s Manifestation Argument: the cognitive and linguistic behaviour of an agent provides no evidence that realist mind/world links exist; - Dummett’s Language Acquisition Argument: if such links were to exist language learning would be impossible; - Putnam’s Brain-in-a-Vat Argument: realism entails both that we could be massively deluded (‘brains in a vat’) and that if we were we could not even form the belief that we were; - Putnam’s Conceptual Relativity Argument: it is senseless to ask what the world contains independently of how we conceive of it, since the objects that exist depend on the conceptual scheme used to classify them; - Putnam’s Model-Theoretic Argument: realists must either hold that an ideal theory passing every conceivable test could be false or that perfectly determinate terms like ‘cat’ are massively indeterminate, and both alternatives are absurd   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/
*  If one is to defend a positive epistemic attitude regarding scientific theories, it is presumably sensible to do so not merely in connection with any theory (especially when one considers that, over the long history of the sciences up to the present, some theories were not or are not especially successful), but rather with respect to theories (or aspects of theories, as we will see momentarily) that would appear, prima facie, to merit such a defense, viz   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structural-realism/
* ) How then are we to decide whether to believe in the full theoretical truth of scientific theories, including what they say about unobservable entities such as electrons and black holes, or whether to believe instead merely that our best scientific theories are empirically adequate? Van Fraassen argues that since the latter belief is logically weaker and yet as empirically contentful as the former belief it is natural for an empiricist to go only as far as belief in empirical adequacy   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism-theory-change/
*  Without denying that theories change over time, scientific realists have tried to block this line of argument by showing that there is substantive continuity in theory-change which warrants the realist’s optimism that current science is on the right track   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasoning-moral/
*  On such a footing, it is possible to launch powerful arguments against the claim that moral principles undergird every moral truth (Dancy 1993) and for the claim that we can sometimes perfectly well decide what to do by acting on the reasons we perceive instinctively – or as we have been trained – without engaging in any moral reasoning   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-agent/
*  However, all reasons are teleological in the sense that any reason for an agent A to X does entail that if a suitable agent (who counts as suitable depends on whether the reason is agent-relative; if it is agent-neutral then any agent will do) can promote A’s X-ing then there is reason for them to do so

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-just-vs-expl/
*  Dancy suggests that the distinction between different types of reason is best understood as one between questions we can ask about them (a view that he finds also in Baier 1958): If we do speak in this way, of motivating and normative reasons, this should not be taken to suggest that there are two sorts of reason, the sort that motivate and the sort that are good

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reism/
*  One can maintain that (1) refers to an immanent object (sense-data in the theory of perception are a good example here)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relations/
*  The next idea that needs to be introduced is the idea of a converse relation   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-relativism/
*  Most often it is associated with an empirical thesis that there are deep and widespread moral disagreements and a metaethical thesis that the truth or justification of moral judgments is not absolute, but relative to the moral standard of some person or group of persons   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/recursive-functions/
*  The sense of this phrase is clarified by the following properties of the system he describes: - the natural numbers are taken as basic objects together with the successor function \(x + 1\); - it is assumed that descriptive functions proven to be equal may be substituted for one another in other expressions; - all definitions of functions and relations on natural numbers are given by recursion; - functional assertions such as (\ref{funassert}) must be proven by induction   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relations-medieval/
*  After this point, there is a noticeable shift away from the Categories paradigm, with the result that many philosophers come to regard those situations in which substances are related by virtue of their accidents as the exception rather than the rule   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reliabilism/
*  Appealing to Primal Systems A different response to the clairvoyance problem is to concede that being the result of a reliable process is not sufficient for a belief to be prima facie justified   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/tropes/
*  A more radical option, finally, is to simply reject the idea that tropes can be informatively categorized either as a kind of property or as a kind of object   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-epistemology/
*  It follows that if the arguments for there being a God, including any arguments from religious experience, are at best probable ones, no one would be justified in having a full belief that there is a God   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-religion/
*  Far from the days of wondering what Athens has to do with Jerusalem, philosophy and religion appeared to have entered a period of detente as comrades in arms   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/
*  What the two approaches have in common is the claim that truth and justification are plural, that there could be more than one correct account of how things stand in at least some domains and their correctness has to be decided relative to a framework of context of assessment   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reid/
*  Reid translates Newton's first rule from Latin as “No more causes, nor any other causes of natural effects ought to be admitted, but such as are both true, and are sufficient for explaining their appearances” and adds in his own voice, “This is a golden rule; it is the true and proper test, by which what is sound and solid in philosophy may be distinguished from what is hollow and vain” (EIP 1   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religious-experience/
*  Discussions of religious experience in terms of feelings, like Schleiermacher’s (1998) “feeling of absolute dependence,” or Otto’s (1923) feeling of the numinous, were important early contributions to theorizing about religious experience, but some have since then argued (see Gellman 2001 and Alston 1991, for example) that religious affective states are not all there is to religious experience   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/natural-theology/
*  The question of whether natural theology is a viable project is at the root of some of the deepest religious divisions: Shi’ite thinkers are optimistic about reason’s ability to prove various theological and ethical truths, for instance, while Sunnis are not; Roman Catholic theologians typically think that reason provides demonstrations of the existence of God, while many Protestant theologians do not   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology-religion/
* ) If someone takes God's goodness to be displayed in, say, a mountain landscape, then the phenomenology of their experience can perhaps be set down easily enough, at least in some central respects; but what about the case where an experience is said to be more directly of God (the case that Alston intends to pick out by the expression “mystical perception”)? Alston suggests that our inability to describe the elements of such experiences from a phenomenological point of view does not imply that they lack a distinctive phenomenology, or that they fail to be directed at some mind-independent reality, in rather the way that sense experiences are   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-religion/
*  But while consensus in precise details is elusive, the following general depiction of what counts as a religion may be helpful: A religion involves a communal, transmittable body of teachings and prescribed practices about an ultimate, sacred reality or state of being that calls for reverence or awe, a body which guides its practitioners into what it describes as a saving, illuminating or emancipatory relationship to this reality through a personally transformative life of prayer, ritualized meditation, and/or moral practices like repentance and personal regeneration   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religious-pluralism/
*  Specifically, our discussion will focus primarily on the following questions: How pervasive is religious diversity? Does the reality of this diversity require a response? Can a person who acknowledges religious diversity remain justified in claiming just one perspective to be correct? If so, is it morally justifiable to attempt to convert others to a different perspective? Can it justifiably be claimed that only one religion offers a path into the eternal presence of God? How should religious diversity be approached in public education? The answers to such questions are not simply academic; they have practical implications   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-morality/
*  In the second chapter God tells Adam that he is free to eat from any tree in the garden, but he must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/black-reparations/
*  This is because his right to reparations is a right to satisfaction for the damages he suffered and such satisfaction often requires that he be made no worse off than he would have been had he not suffered the loss   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-science/
*  Explicit methodological naturalism arose in the nineteenth century with the X-club, a lobby group for the professionalization of science founded in 1864 by Thomas Huxley and friends, which aimed to promote a science that would be free from religious dogmas   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/replication/
*  What exactly is a replicator? How are replicators different from genes? Can evolution by natural selection occur without the existence of replicators? Besides the biological domain, are there any other domains in which replicators have been postulated? To answer these questions, we will first provide some background for Dawkins’ notion of replicator and its ties with the concepts of the gene and information   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religious-language/
*  Indeed, the attention that some theories of religious language receive is in part due to their divergence from a face value interpretation   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/political-representation/
*  Indeed, as we will see, the concept of political representation has multiple and competing dimensions: our common understanding of political representation is one that contains different, and conflicting, conceptions of how political representatives should represent and so holds representatives to standards that are mutually incompatible   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/republicanism/
*  Political Liberty as Non-Domination Absolutely central to the contemporary civic republican program is the conception of political liberty as non-domination or independence from arbitrary power, and so it makes good sense to begin with an explication of this idea   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-politics/
* , that citizens in a pluralistic liberal democracy ought to refrain from using their political influence to authorize coercive laws that, to the best of their knowledge, can be justified only on religious grounds and so lack a plausible secular rationale   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/imaginative-resistance/
*  At other times, we do not seem to be able to play along that easily; for instance, when we are presented with an alternative Macbeth where the facts of [Duncan’s] murder remain as they are in fact presented in the play, but it is prescribed in this alternate fiction that this was unfortunate only for having interfered with Macbeth’s sleep   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-representation/
*  Hence, representations other than scientific representations also allow for surrogative reasoning, which raises the question: how do scientific representations differ from other kinds of representations that allow for surrogative reasoning? Callender and Cohen (2006: 68–69) point out that this is a version Popper’s demarcation problem, now phrased in terms of representation, and so we refer to it as the Representational Demarcation Problem   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/
*  However, this view implies that any loss in the quality of lives in a population can be compensated for by a sufficient gain in the quantity of a population; that is, it leads to the Repugnant Conclusion   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/richard-sophister/
*  Abstractiones The title “Abstractiones” was apparently meant to capture the “excerpted” nature of this collection of sophisms that are presented in a somewhat summary fashion   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/divine-revelation/
*  In addition to a revealer (m) and an audience (n), an act of revelation must have a content (a) that is made known or available to the audience through some means (k)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/collective-responsibility/
*  Instead, it is about the moral responsibility of individuals who belong to groups that are themselves thought to be morally responsible for particular cases of harm   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/revolution/
* [6] Even if that is true as a generalization, the question remains as to whether there are exceptions—cases where nonviolence is not likely to achieve the aims of just revolution or would only achieve them with undue costs in terms of human well-being—and whether they can be identified ex ante   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ricoeur/
*  It did, however, lead him not only to revisit that work but also to see more clearly its broader implications, particularly in relation to and in response to the development of structuralism which he saw as a challenge to such a hermeneutic approach   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-reproducibility/
*  Internal Validity and Controlling for Artefactual Results: If a replication study differs with respect to the site, experimenters or apparatus, then its purpose is to establish that previously observed results are not an artefact of a particular apparatus, lab or so on   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/respect/
*  So, if it is true that all persons are owed or have a moral right to respect just as persons, then the concept of respect for person has to be analyzed as some form or combination of forms of recognition or reverential respect   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-retributive/
* Retributive Justice The concept of retributive justice has been used in a variety of ways, but it is best understood as that form of justice committed to the following three principles: - that those who commit certain kinds of wrongful acts, paradigmatically serious crimes, morally deserve to suffer a proportionate punishment; - that it is intrinsically morally good—good without reference to any other goods that might arise—if some legitimate punisher gives them the punishment they deserve; and - that it is morally impermissible intentionally to punish the innocent or to inflict disproportionately large punishments on wrongdoers   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heinrich-rickert/
*  Rickert argues that we can tackle the problem of the theory of knowledge in two ways: “One can begin first with an analysis of the real act of knowledge as a psychic process and then, from there, move progressively to determine the transcendent object   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights-children/
*  One very obvious way in which the question of what children are entitled to do or to be or to have is raised is by asking, Do children have rights? If so, do they have all the rights that adults have and do they have rights that adults do not have? If they do not have rights how do we ensure that they are treated in the morally right way? Most jurisdictions accord children legal rights   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights-group/
*  Whether we conceive a group as having an identity and being that supersedes that of its members turns not just on what we find in the world, but also on how we choose to see it   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/civil-rights/
*  And the claims of blacks to be served by a business or to travel in a railroad car to which whites had access were denied with the assertion that civil rights did not touch upon social matters such as the decisions of persons and businesses to associate with the members of one race but not another   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-rights/
*  The remaining approaches can be categorised in different ways, but a main division is between those who think that rights are singled out by their great weight as practical reasons, and those who think that rights are not special in this regard, but instead are to be analysed into duties, permissions, powers, etc, or some combination of these, perhaps with the addition of other conditions   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/
*  To take another example, there seems nothing incoherent in the thought that individuals have a right not to be protected by society; yet this thought could not make sense on Mill’s characterization of what rights are   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights-human/
*  One can argue, of course, that goal-like rights are not real rights, but it may be better to recognize that they comprise a weak but useful notion of a right (See Beitz 2009 for a defense of the view that not all human rights are rights in a strong sense   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/territorial-rights/
*  To address this question, the theory needs an argument that relates people and land to the state in ways that justify rights over particular bits of territory, and this is a difficult problem for one of the most prominent theories of territory—justice theories   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/risk/
*  - risk = the fact that a decision is made under conditions of known probabilities (“decision under risk” as opposed to “decision under uncertainty”) In addition to these five common meanings of “risk” there are several other more technical meanings, which are well-established in specialized fields of inquiry   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/special-obligations/
*  Thus, the mere fact that someone is my friend (or my mother, or my colleague, or my fellow citizen) does not imply that I have any obligations to such a person that I do not have to any and all persons   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rorty/
*  Rorty’s position is not that these conceptual contrasts never have application, but that such application is always context and interest bound and that there is, as in the case of the related notion of truth, nothing to be said about them in general   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ai/
*  The ethics of AI and robotics has seen significant press coverage in recent years, which supports related research, but also may end up undermining it: the press often talks as if the issues under discussion were just predictions of what future technology will bring, and as though we already know what would be most ethical and how to achieve that   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rosenstock-huessy/
*  His social philosophy is concerned with how, when a world implodes on or devours them—through what he terms the four social diseases of anarchy, decadence, revolution and war (1970a, 11–16)—people can escape the tyranny of forces that have come to rule the space in which they dwell by founding a new time which will then open up other spatial possibilities   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rosenzweig/
*  At stake for Rosenzweig appear to have been questions closely linked to those he had contemplated during the Baden-Baden experiment and which remained on his mind as he investigated Hegel’s coming of age in Hegel und der Staat: how can our radical subjectivity or selfhood be reconciled with our grasp of the world? and how must the divine be conceived such that it be understood as grounding and unifying both selfhood and worldliness? The failure at Baden-Baden had led Rosenzweig to question his earlier historicist view that individual subjects might find their fulfillment as subjects in the world by joining together to form a zeitgeistig unity, worshipping in the Zeitgeist “the God revealing itself in the here and now   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rigid-designators/
*  The only respect in which it might have turned out false is not metaphysical but epistemic: thus, one could as well say of a geometrical theorem before it is proven that it might or might not turn out to be true or that it might or might not be provable without the parallels postulate   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/antonio-rosmini/
*  The role of the philosopher is to distinguish the form of difficulties, which may vary from age to age or generation to generation, and to formulate questions in such a way that it is possible to see both their historical antecedents and the underlying principles to be employed in solving them   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rousseau/
*  The concern that dominates Rousseau’s work is to find a way of preserving human freedom in a world where human beings are increasingly dependent on one another for the satisfaction of their needs   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/william-david-ross/
*  If the opinions of the thoughtful and well-educated are distinct from those of the plain man, and Ross (with some justification) cares more about the former than the latter, he may have a moral view that is closer on the matter of reform (though not of system) to Sidgwick's

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sylvan-routley/
*  As Brady and Sylvan put it, We believe that the deep structure of natural languages, and hence of the languages in which philosophical problems are characteristically formulated, will have to be based on an enriched significance logic which has a third value—nonsense or nonsignificance—and not on a classical two-valued logic which only has truth and falsity as its values (Brady and Routley 1973, 211)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/royce/
*  Royce generalized the difference between true loyalty and vicious or “predatory” loyalty as follows: a cause is good, not only for me, but for mankind, in so far as it is essentially a loyalty to loyalty, that is, an aid and a furtherance of loyalty in my fellows   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism-rule/
*  In that case, we could hold: Actualist rule-consequentialist criterion of wrongness: An act is wrong if and only if it is forbidden by rules the acceptance of which would actually result in the greatest good   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rule-of-law/
*  Those are rules of law, but the Rule of Law is one of the ideals of our political morality and it refers to the ascendancy of law as such and of the institutions of the legal system in a system of governance   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-atomism/
* , a proposition, consisting of a, b and R even when it is not true that a bears relation R to b, and (3) in 1903, Russell believed in the reality of classes, understood as aggregate objects, which could be constituents of propositions   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/
*  Such a set appears to be a member of itself if and only if it is not a member of itself   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/
*  Russell’s basic idea was that reference to sets such as the so-called Russell set (the set of all sets that are not members of themselves) could be avoided by arranging all sentences into a hierarchy, beginning with sentences about individuals at the lowest level, sentences about sets of individuals at the next lowest level, sentences about sets of sets of individuals at the next lowest level, and so on   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/saadya/
*  And so, following upon an opening passage of epistemological praise to “the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom the truth is known with absolute certainty,” Saadya begins the Amânât, with a statement of his work's epistemological purpose: …I will begin this book, which it is my intention to write, with an exposition of the reason why men, in their search for Truth, become involved in errors, and how these errors can be removed so that the objects of their investigations may be fully attained; moreover, why some of these errors have such a powerful hold on some people that they affirm them as the truth, deluding themselves that they know something… (Altmann, 27)[1] The sad state of affairs among men which Saadya sees as the impetus for his work is described a few lines later in terms of erroneous life-patterns which stem from various failures of reason: I have been led to make these introductory remarks by my observation of the state of many people in regard to their doctrines and beliefs [note: this is the title of the work]   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ryle/
*  Second, and importantly, Ryle is not a philosophical behaviourist—at least he does not subscribe to any of the main tenets associated with that doctrine as it is known today   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/saantarak-sita/
*  Having examined all those phenomena which his philosophical opponents claim have or are of a truly singular nature and determined through reasoned analysis that they in fact, could not possibly have or be of a truly singular nature, Śāntarakṣita proceeds to consider the possibility of there being a truly manifold nature in phenomena   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-moral/
*  Moore is famous for the claim, which he professes to prove by means of what has come to be known as the Open Question Argument, that there is a “non-natural” property of goodness, not identical with or reducible to any other property or assemblage of properties, and that what we ought to do is to maximize the good and minimize the bad   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/shantideva/
*  There are two complete translations of the ŚS into English (Bendall & Rouse 1922, and in SS-G), as well as a very precise and careful translation limited to the verses by Śāntideva that appear in the text (Harrison 2013)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sakya-pandita/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/organs-sale/
*  It may be objected to empirically, with the critic arguing either that permitting organ sale would be ineffective or that an alternative system would work better: for example, the ways in which we approach bereaved relatives could be improved, as could the ways in which the possibility of (unpaid) living donation is publicized, or there could be a move to a Mandated Choice or Presumed Consent system (Hinkley 2005)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wesley-salmon/
*  Convinced that our knowledge is uncertain and that causality ought to be defined in probabilistic terms, he pursued a probabilistic version of mechanicism, opening a new trend of research in the literature on explanation, known as “neo-mechanicism”   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/francisco-sanches/
*  Did that mean that if the comet were only seen by the peoples of India, it would only have an effect on that particular population, and not on the peoples of the south of France? If comets only predicted certain things, one was left to ask: why these and not others? And what is more, why could they not equally be the cause of good things? “There is no reason for it”, says Sanches (CC: 186: 563)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/shankara/
*  According to Śaṅkara, a corollary of his position on nondual existence is that the world we perceive is less-than-real or illusory in some way in comparison to its ground   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sartre/
*  But it is clear that Sartre devoted much of his early philosophical attention to combating the then influential Bergsonism and that mention of Bergson's name decreases as that of Heidegger grows in Sartre's writings during the “vintage” existentialist years   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism/
*  The first principle in question may be thought of as enshrining the possibility of knowledge (and justification) by ampliative inference: Ampliativity: It is possible for a subject S to be justified in believing h on the basis of evidence e even if S does not have independent justification (of at least the same degree of S’s justification for believing h) for believing a proposition p such that p and e together entail h   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scheler/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schlegel-aw/
*  Although the philosophical dimension and profundity of his writings remain underrated, he is considered to be one of the founders of the German Romantic Movement—which he conceived of as a European movement—as well as one of the most prominent disseminators of its philosophical foundational ideas, not only in Germany but also abroad and, most notably, in Britain   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schlick/
*  In 1917, he published Space and Time in Contemporary Physics, a philosophical introduction to the new physics of Relativity which was highly acclaimed by Einstein himself as well as many others   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schleiermacher/
*  But that is arguably not so: Herder had already included them in a way as well; contrary to first appearances, doing so need not conflict with a suitably interpreted doctrine that meanings are word-usages; and the currently popular attack on such “psychologism” in modern philosophy of language influenced by Frege and Wittgenstein, which is likely to make such a position seem suspect, may well itself be misguided   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schmitt/
*  Schmitt realizes, of course, that it is possible for people who are not willing to identify in this way to be legally recognized as citizens, and to live law-abidingly, under the norms authorized by some positive constitution   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scholem/
*  His historiographical musings in Major Trends are important because it is here we are presented with Scholem's dialectical approach to history and his claim, for example, that Lurianic Kabbala with its intense focus on creation as rupture and catastrophe was a response to the Jewish expulsion from Spain in 1492   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scholz/
*  Furthermore, with his Geschichte der Logik (Scholz 1931a) Heinrich Scholz was a pioneer in the historiography of logic   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schlegel/
*  Schlegel remained in Jena for almost a year, but then moved to Berlin, where he became a regular visitor to the salons of Henriette Herz and Rahel Levin and established contact with several important figures of the Romantic movement   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/school-names/
*  Names names for “kinds” (lei)—one type of general term— are regarded as denoting all things or stuff (shi) that is “the same” in one or more respects, such as all horses, which share the same shape (xing) and appearance (mao)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schopenhauer/
*  Leibniz (1646–1716) had defined the principle of this assumption – the principle of sufficient reason – in his Monadology (1714) as that which requires us to acknowledge that there is no fact or truth that lacks a sufficient reason why it should be so, and not otherwise   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schopenhauer-aesthetics/
*  Notwithstanding this nearly universally shared capacity for aesthetic experience, Schopenhauer remarks that it is enjoyed only occasionally by the majority of people and is enjoyed in a very sustained manner and to a high degree only by the genius   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schutz/
*  He then went on to produce his major life’s work, The Phenomenology of the Social World (1932), a work for which Husserl praised him as “an earnest and profound phenomenologist   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/
*  This is an indication that there is still much important philosophical work to be done on the demarcation between science and pseudoscience

*  Carranza was reported to be reading Luther’s works, a sign of future troubles in which his Commentary on the Christian Catechism was criticized by both Cano and Soto   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/
*  Even if, from an ontological point of view, anything can be a model and the class of things that are referred to as models contains a heterogeneous collection of different things, it does not follow that it is either impossible or pointless to develop an ontology of models   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-theory-observation/
*  This focus made sense on the assumption that a scientific theory is a system of sentences or sentence-like structures (propositions, statements, claims, and so on) to be tested by comparison to observational evidence   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-discovery/
*  It is the task of the logic of discovery to draw out and give a schematic representation of the reasoning strategies that were applied in episodes of successful scientific inquiry   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-explanation/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-knowledge-social/
*  The responsibility of scientists is to make sure that values do not play a direct role in their work and to be transparent about the indirect roles of values   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-method/
*  How these are carried out in detail can vary greatly, but characteristics like these have been looked to as a way of demarcating scientific activity from non-science, where only enterprises which employ some canonical form of scientific method or methods should be considered science (see also the entry on science and pseudo-science)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-pluralism/
*  While scientific pluralism has often been framed in opposition to the unity of science and “the ancient notion of philosophy as unified knowledge” (Cat 2012), pluralist philosophy of science has become a broad platform for negotiating post-positivist philosophy of science in the light of epistemic and social diversity   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-progress/
*  The task of philosophical analysis is to consider alternative answers to the question: What is meant by progress in science? This conceptual question can then be complemented by the methodological question: How can we recognize progressive developments in science? Relative to a definition of progress and an account of its best indicators, one may then study the factual question: To what extent, and in which respects, is science progressive? - 1

*  A scientific account cast in the language of the absolute conception may not only be able to explain why a tree is as tall as it is but also why we see it in one way when viewed from one standpoint and in a different way when viewed from another   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-unity/
*  The underlying question of the unity of our types of knowledge was explicitly addressed by Plato in the Sophist as follows: “Knowledge also is surely one, but each part of it that commands a certain field is marked off and given a special name proper to itself   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/
*  If one is to defend a positive epistemic attitude regarding scientific theories, it is presumably sensible to do so not merely in connection with any theory (especially when one considers that, over the long history of the sciences up to the present, some theories were not or are not especially successful), but rather with respect to theories (or aspects of theories, as we will see momentarily) that would appear, prima facie, to merit such a defense, viz   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-representation/
*  Hence, representations other than scientific representations also allow for surrogative reasoning, which raises the question: how do scientific representations differ from other kinds of representations that allow for surrogative reasoning? Callender and Cohen (2006: 68–69) point out that this is a version Popper’s demarcation problem, now phrased in terms of representation, and so we refer to it as the Representational Demarcation Problem   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-big-data/
*  The body of digital data created by research is growing at breakneck pace and in ways that are arguably impossible for the human cognitive system to grasp and thus require some form of automated analysis   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incommensurability/
*  By calling two fundamental theories incommensurable, Feyerabend meant that they were conceptually incompatible: The main concepts of one could neither be defined on the basis of the primitive descriptive terms of the other, nor related to them via a correct empirical statement (Feyerabend 1962, 74, 90)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottish-18th/
*  As regards Hobbes, Hutcheson thought his doctrine was both wrong and dangerous; wrong because by the frame of our nature we have compassionate, generous and benevolent affections which owe nothing at all to calculations of self-interest, and dangerous because people may be discouraged from the morally worthy exercise of cultivating generous affections in themselves on the grounds that the exercise of such affections is really an exercise in dissimulation or pretence   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-underdetermination/
*  Moreover, claims of underdetermination of either of these two fundamental varieties can vary in strength and character in any number of further ways: one might, for example, suggest that the choice between two theories or two ways of revising our beliefs is transiently underdetermined simply by the evidence we happen to have at present, or instead permanently underdetermined by all possible evidence   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-revolutions/
*  Or if there was a revolution, should it not be attributed to Kepler, Galileo, and Descartes? This thought further problematizes the notion of revolution, for science studies experts as well as scientists themselves know that scientific and technological innovation can be extremely nonlinear in the sense that a seemingly small, rather ordinary development may eventually open up an entire new domain of research problems or a powerful new approach   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottish-19th/
*  Brown was a poet and physician as well as a philosopher, and a rather more independent thinker than Stewart, so much so, in fact, that Stewart regarded him as something of a traitor to the philosophy of Reid   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism-theory-change/
*  Without denying that theories change over time, scientific realists have tried to block this line of argument by showing that there is substantive continuity in theory-change which warrants the realist’s optimism that current science is on the right track   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structure-scientific-theories/
*  What is the best characterization of the composition and function of scientific theory? How is theory linked with world? Which philosophical tools can and should be employed in describing and reconstructing scientific theory? Is an understanding of practice and application necessary for a comprehension of the core structure of a scientific theory? Finally, and most generally, how are these three views ultimately related? - 1

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/secession/
*  Consider, for example, a remedial right only theory that includes among the grounds for the (unilateral) right to secede the following: (a) large-scale and persistent violations of basic human rights, (b) unjust taking of the territory of a legitimate state (where secession is simply the taking back of wrongly taken territory, as with the secession of the Baltic Republics from the Soviet Union in 1991), and (c) in certain cases, the state’s persisting violation of agreements to accord a minority group limited self-government within the state (Buchanan 2004) or perhaps even refusal to enter into negotiations aimed at agreement on an intrastate autonomy regime   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-search/
*  Search Engine Development and Evolution: A Short History Because search engines provide Internet users with access to important information by directing them to links to available online resources on a plethora of topics, many are inclined to see search engine technology in a positive light; some might also assume, as Noble (2018) and others note, that this technology is “value-neutral   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-self/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-deception/
*  One reason for thinking self-deception is analogous to interpersonal deception of this sort is that it helps us to distinguish self-deception from mere error, since the acquisition and maintenance of the false belief is intentional not accidental   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemic-self-doubt/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/respect/
*  So, if it is true that all persons are owed or have a moral right to respect just as persons, then the concept of respect for person has to be analyzed as some form or combination of forms of recognition or reverential respect   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meaning-holism/
*  The “belief-focused” and “inference-focused” ways of characterizing use-based holism are often treated as interchangeable,[2] and will be so treated here unless the distinction is particularly relevant in a context,[3] and so for our purposes here, meaning holism will be understood as the following general view: The determinants of the meanings of our terms are interconnected in a way that leads a change in the meaning of any single term to produce a change in the meanings of each of the rest

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/defaults-semantics-pragmatics/
*  Next, some, following Grice, consider such pragmatic contributions to utterance meaning to be generalized conversational implicatures (Levinson), others classify them as pragmatic input to what is said, albeit using a variety of theory-specific labels (Recanati, Carston), reserving the term ‘implicature’ for meanings that can be represented by a separate logical form and that function independently from the content of the main utterance in reasoning   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/montague-semantics/
*  In fact, Montague’s semantic work owes a lot to Quine’s descriptive insights into the ‘logic of ordinary English’, but differs from his predecessor by making the connection between language and logic in rigorous, mathematical terms: It should be emphasized that this is not a matter of vague intuition, as in elementary logic courses, but an assertion to which we have assigned exact significance

*  For it is part of the intrinsic logic of any commentary tradition — a close parallel can be found in the Indian tradition of logic and semiotics that we do not discuss here — that all later commentaries, which in many cases are actually meta-commentaries, have to compete with the previous ones and to surpass them in elaboration by taking up, evaluating, or commenting on their arguments and terminological distinctions

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/settheory-early/
*  The case of Bolzano suggests that a liberation from metric concepts (which came with the development of theories of projective geometry and especially of topology) was to have a crucial role in making possible the abstract viewpoint of set theory   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/set-theory-constructive/

*  On this view, although there are practical reasons that one might give in favour of one set of axioms over another—say, that it is more useful for a given task—, there are no theoretical reasons that can be given; and, moreover, this either implies or is a consequence of the fact—depending on the variant of the view, in particular, whether it places realism before reason, or conversely—that there is no objective mathematical realm at this level   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zermelo-set-theory/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sex-sexuality/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sharpe/
*  In the third decade of the fourteenth century, Ockham argued that the common realist account of the relationship between universals and individuals was inconsistent with the standard definition of real identity, according to which two items a and b are identical if and only if for all x, x is predicated of a if and only x is predicated of b   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotions-17th18th/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sextus-empiricus/
*  Sextus turns to the question of whether the skeptic has any beliefs in a very famous—and much debated—passage, PH I 13 (in Annas and Barnes’ translation): When we say that Skeptics do not hold beliefs, we do not take ‘belief’ in the sense in which some say, quite generally, that belief is acquiescing in something; for Skeptics assent to the feelings forced upon them by appearances—for example, they would not say, when heated or chilled, ‘I think I am not heated (or: chilled)’

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/

*  Derk Pereboom provides a very helpful definition of the kind of moral responsibility being doubted by skeptics, which he calls basic desert moral responsibility and defines as follows: For an agent to be morally responsible for an action in this sense is for it to be hers in such a way that she would deserve to be blamed if she understood that it was morally wrong, and she would deserve to be praised if she understood that it was morally exemplary

*  And so we ask, what reason can a person have for recognizing and accepting a constraint that is independent of his desires and interests? … [W]hat justifies paying attention to morality, rather than dismissing it as an appendage of outworn beliefs? If our justificatory problem is not simply to understand what morality requires, but whether morality ought to be paid attention to, or instead dismissed as a superstition based on outmoded metaphysical theories, then obviously the parties to the agreement must not employ moral judgments in their reasoning

If so, can this true motion be analyzed in terms of motions relative to other bodies – to some special body, or to the entire universe perhaps? (And in relativity, in which distances, times and measures of relative motion are frame-dependent, what relations are relevant?) If not, then how is the privileged kind of motion to be understood, as relative to space itself – something physical but non-material – perhaps? Or can some kinds of motion be best understood as not being spatial changes – changes of relative location or of place – at all? 2

*  When a person feels pain, does it follow that the pain is ultimately just a property of God, and thus that God feels pain? All of this has given rise to a great deal of scholarly debate as to what Spinoza means by saying all things being modes of or “in” God   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-epistemology-mind/
*  Ontologically, all the things familiar to us from ordinary experience – animals, plants, inanimate objects – are for Spinoza merely modifications or “modes” of the single substance, “ways [modis]” that God is, just as (to borrow examples from Lin 2018) a wrinkle in a rug is one way a rug can be, and a fist one way a hand can be

How are the principles of inertia and the collision laws that follow from it to be accounted for, given that they cannot be grounded in God's immutable will? What is the nature of the individual striving of bodies, and how can it be reconciled with Spinoza's deterministic dynamics of Extension? These issues cannot be addressed independently of one another

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottish-18th/
*  As regards Hobbes, Hutcheson thought his doctrine was both wrong and dangerous; wrong because by the frame of our nature we have compassionate, generous and benevolent affections which owe nothing at all to calculations of self-interest, and dangerous because people may be discouraged from the morally worthy exercise of cultivating generous affections in themselves on the grounds that the exercise of such affections is really an exercise in dissimulation or pretence   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/max-stirner/
*  The historical impact of The Ego and Its Own is sometimes difficult to assess, but Stirner’s work can confidently be said: to have had an immediate and destructive impact on the left-Hegelian movement; to have played an important contemporary role in the intellectual development of Karl Marx (1818–1883); and subsequently to have influenced significantly the political tradition of individualist anarchism   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/

* 2 Consolidation and Further Discussions in the 1980s One way to understand Benacerraf’s discussion in his 1965 article is that he proposes to treat the natural number structure as a new kind of abstract entity, different from set-theoretic objects and systems of objects   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physics-structuralism/
*  For example, we might require that all forces are gravitational and that the net force on the mass \(m\) be given by the sum \(\bF=\Sigma_i \bF_i\) of all gravitational forces \(\bF_i\) acting on the mass due to the other masses of the universe, in accord with Newton’s inverse square law of gravity   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structural-realism/
* ) How then are we to decide whether to believe in the full theoretical truth of scientific theories, including what they say about unobservable entities such as electrons and black holes, or whether to believe instead merely that our best scientific theories are empirically adequate? Van Fraassen argues that since the latter belief is logically weaker and yet as empirically contentful as the former belief it is natural for an empiricist to go only as far as belief in empirical adequacy   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/johann-sturm/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-substructural/
*  In relevant logics the rule of weakening fails on the other side too, in that we wish this argument to be invalid too:\[ \cfrac{q \vdash q} { \cfrac{p, q \vdash q} {p \vdash q \rightarrow q} } \] Again, \(q\) may follow from \(q\), but this does not mean that it follows from \(p\) together with \(q\), provided that “together with” is meant in an appropriately strong sense   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/substance/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/supererogation/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/advance-directives/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sylvan-routley/
*  As Brady and Sylvan put it, We believe that the deep structure of natural languages, and hence of the languages in which philosophical problems are characteristically formulated, will have to be based on an enriched significance logic which has a third value—nonsense or nonsignificance—and not on a classical two-valued logic which only has truth and falsity as its values (Brady and Routley 1973, 211)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/symmetry-breaking/
*  Where does this definition stem from? In addition to the ancient notion of symmetry used by the Greeks and Romans (current until the end of the Renaissance), a different notion of symmetry emerged in the seventeenth century, grounded not on proportions but on an equality relation between elements that are opposed, such as the left and right parts of a figure

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/teleological-arguments/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/telesio/
*  In order to explain how all natural beings came into existence by these opposing forces, Telesio presumed that in the beginning God had created two primary globes, the sun and the earth, the sun being the seat of heat, the earth that of coldness, and that He had separated them with such a distance in space that they could not extinguish each other (DRN book I, ch   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-teleological/

*  He came to view this is as mistake, and in later writings he argued that the difference between the content of a proteraesthesis and an ordinary (present) sensation lies not in the nature of the object of which we are aware, but rather the way in which we are aware of it – there are ‘temporal modes of consciousness’   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/territorial-rights/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/
*  Global atheists might object that, even if atheism and (metaphysical) naturalism are not identical, a belief in the former can be based on a belief in the latter; in other words, if one has good arguments for the view that nature is a closed system, then that removes any burden to consider each God-concept separately, so long as all legitimate concepts of God imply that God is a supernatural entity—that is, an entity that is not natural, yet affects nature

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/theophrastus/
*  It is true that Theophrastus pointed out difficulties and obscurities with regard to some of Aristotle’s theories, but he did not explicitly abandon them or put anything different in their place; his modifications were most likely intended as suggestions within the Aristotelian framework, and his efforts seem to have been directed at developing the Aristotelian system as well as at meeting various objections against it

*  The question is: are there any constraints on the sort of data which can be put on S and continued to a global solution of the dynamics which are different from the constraints (if any) on the data which can be put on a Cauchy surface in a simply connected manifold and continued to a global solution? If there is time travel to our future, might we we able to tell this now, because of some implied oddity in the arrangement of present things? It is not at all surprising that there might be constraints on the data which can be put on a locally space-like surface which passes through the time travel region: after all, we never think we can freely specify what happens on a space-like surface and on another such surface to its future, but in this case the surface at issue lies to its own future

*  Diogenes names two kings with whom he was acquainted, and several poets with whom he collaborated; it is difficult to know what to make of this information, although the recent work of Clayman (2010) has shown, by means of detailed parallels with contemporary poetry, that he was deeply immersed in the poetic world of his time

*  Moreover, the general problem this raises is that if such a response by the skeptic is plausible in the case of language, perhaps it is also plausible in the case of other starting-points too? Thus, for example, when it comes to skepticism about the existence of the external world or other minds, maybe no argument can be constructed to show there must actually be such a world or minds as a condition for inner experience or the having of thoughts, but just that we must believe them to exist, or that they must seem to us to do so—which hardly looks like enough to quash skeptical doubts on these matters   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-transcendental/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-transworld/
* 3 Against the ‘intelligibility’ assumption A third job for a criterion of transworld identity might be this: in order to understand the claim that there is some possible world in which George Eliot is a scientist, perhaps we must be able to give an informative answer to the question ‘What would it take for a scientist in another possible world to be identical with Eliot?’ Again, however, it can be argued that this demand is illegitimate, at least if what is demanded is that one be able to specify a set of properties whose possession, in another possible world, by an individual in that world, is non-trivially necessary and sufficient for being George Eliot (cf   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-identity/
*  A point which has perhaps been obscured in the literature on this topic, but which should be noticed, is that (7) asserts a relation of subordination: it says that true thinkables are a (proper or improper) subset of facts; it implicitly allows that there might be facts that are not identical with true thinkables

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-values/
*  According to Kneale and Kneale (1962: 413), Boole’s system contains all that is needed for its interpretation “in terms of truth values of propositions”, and as Church (1956: 17) remarks, the “explicit use of two truth-values appears for the first time in a paper by C   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottish-18th/
*  As regards Hobbes, Hutcheson thought his doctrine was both wrong and dangerous; wrong because by the frame of our nature we have compassionate, generous and benevolent affections which owe nothing at all to calculations of self-interest, and dangerous because people may be discouraged from the morally worthy exercise of cultivating generous affections in themselves on the grounds that the exercise of such affections is really an exercise in dissimulation or pretence   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truthmakers/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/
*  This general approach can be applied at different levels to different normative properties of different kinds of things, but the most prominent example is probably consequentialism about the moral rightness of acts, which holds that whether an act is morally right depends only on the consequences of that act or of something related to that act, such as the motive behind the act or a general rule requiring acts of the same kind

*  The premise in question, which has been referred to as the “Swamping Thesis” (Pritchard 2011), states that if the value of a property possessed by an item is instrumentally valuable only relative to a further good, and that good is already present in that item, then it can confer no additional value   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/value-theory/

What is named by my name? What perceives perceptions, or experiences experiences, or enacts actions, if not the self? What is memory, without a self? And crucially, from a Buddhist perspective, what transmigrates from one body to the next, and reaps the karmic fruit of good and evil deeds, if not a self? These are all questions of great importance in Buddhist philosophical treatments of the doctrine of no-self, and Vasubandhu will address them each in due course

How have we arrived at such an odd conclusion?

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wilhelm-windelband/
*  Although Windelband thinks of his project as an anti-metaphysical “scientific philosophy”, he is keen to secure for philosophy a role that is independent of the special sciences   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weyl/
*  The basic idea underlying the general theory of relativity was Einstein’s recognition that the metric field, which has such powerful real effects on matter, cannot be a rigid once and for all given geometric structure of the spacetime, but must itself be something real, that not only has effects on matter, but is in turn also affected by matter   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein-aesthetics/
*  It is true that we have the notes assembled from his lectures on aesthetics given to a small group of students in private rooms in Cambridge in the summer of 1938 (Wittgenstein 1966) and we have G   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/
*  Traditional metaphysics, and the propositions of ethics and aesthetics, which try to capture the world as a whole, are also excluded, as is the truth in solipsism, the very notion of a subject, for it is also not “in” the world but at its limit   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein-atomism/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wolff-christian/
*  An important part of the reason why Wolff believes that there is a rational order to science is because of the progress he believes he has witnessed in such sciences as astronomy and optics, which he believes have utilized such an order when establishing various scientific truths (DP: §139)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein-mathematics/
*  On Wittgenstein’s view, we invent mathematical calculi and we expand mathematics by calculation and proof, and though we learn from a proof that a theorem can be derived from axioms by means of certain rules in a particular way, it is not the case that this proof-path pre-exists our construction of it   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/work-labor/
*  The Christian tradition contains several different views of work, including that work is toil for human sin, that work should be a calling or vocation by which one glorifies God or carries out God’s will, and that work is an arena in which to manifest one’s status as elect in the eyes of God (the ‘Protestant work ethic’)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/word-meaning/
* , on theories that try to provide an answer to such questions as “what is the nature of word meaning?”, “what do we know when we know the meaning of a word?”, and “what (kind of) information must a speaker associate to the words of a language in order to be a competent user of its lexicon?”   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wright/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wyclif/
*  Like William of Sherwood, Peter of Spain, and Burley, and against Ockham and his followers, Wyclif affirms that the supposition is simple if the term stands for an extra-mental universal only, as it occurs in ‘Man can be predicated of every man’, and ‘Man is a species’   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wilhelm-wundt/
*  Wundt defines consciousness as “inner experience;” it is only the “immediately real”[16] phenomena constituting this experience, and nothing behind or beyond it, that is the object of psychological, as opposed to physiological or psychophysical investigation (PP II: 636)   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/possible-worlds/
*  On the assumption that there is a (nonempty) set of all possible worlds and a set of all possible individuals, we can define “objective” notions of truth at a world and of truth simpliciter, that is, notions that are not simply relative to formal, mathematical interpretations but, rather, correspond to objective reality in all its modal glory   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/xunzi/
*  Famously, Mencius argued that the xing of human beings is good (shan 善), by which he meant that all human beings have the capacity to become good, even though, in reality, not all people are good, because they fail to exert themselves sufficiently—or even take the obligation seriously   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/yorck/

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zeno-elea/
*  Plato then presents an exchange between Socrates and Zeno, the first part of which is as follows: Once Socrates had heard it, he asked Zeno to read the first hypothesis of the first argument again, and, after it was read, he said: “What do you mean by this, Zeno? ‘If the things that are are many, that then they must be both like and unlike, but this is impossible   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/
*  First are there ‘always others between the things that are’? (In modern terminology, why must objects always be ‘densely’ ordered?) Suppose that we had imagined a collection of ten apples lined up; then there is indeed another apple between the sixth and eighth, but there is none between the seventh and eighth! On the assumption that Zeno is not simply confused, what does he have in mind? The texts do not say, but here are two possibilities: first, one might hold that for any pair of physical objects (two apples say) to be two distinct objects and not just one (a ‘double-apple’) there must be a third between them, physically separating them, even if it is just air   

## https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zermelo-set-theory/
*  We took it as axiomatic that the class as one is to be found wherever there is a class as many; but this axiom need not be universally admitted, and appears to have been the source of the contradiction
