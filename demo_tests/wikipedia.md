* **Density 3.8** -> 11  Those with an internal locus of control are more likely to be satisfied with their job and life because they believe in their own control over the situation
* **Density 6** -> 113  On the other hand, this study acknowledged that another explanation could be that those with high core self-evaluations are confident in their actions and will seek out more ambitious goals, which will lead to higher perceived meaningfulness, and later, higher job satisfaction
## Hawking radiation
* **Density 1** -> 39The black hole is the background spacetime for a quantum field theory
* **Density 3** -> 3Hawking radiation reduces the mass and rotational energy of black holes and is therefore also theorized to cause black hole evaporation

Is sport psychology a branch of kinesiology or sport and exercise science (like exercise physiology and athletic training)? Is it a branch of psychology or counseling? Or is it an independent discipline?Danish and Hale (1981) contended that many clinical psychologists were using medical models of psychology to problematize sport problems as signs of mental illness instead of drawing upon the empirical knowledge base generated by sport psychology researchers, which in many cases indicated that sport problems were not signs of mental illness

## Object lifetime
* **Density 1** -> 0In object-oriented programming (OOP), the object lifetime (or life cycle) of an object is the time between an object's creation and its destruction

* **Density 6** -> 15 Since multiple reader threads may hold the lock at once, this means that a writer thread may continue waiting for the lock while new reader threads are able to acquire the lock, even to the point where the writer may still be waiting after all of the readers which were holding the lock when it first attempted to acquire it have released the lock

## Reference (computer science)
* **Density 0.4** -> 18ExamplesPointers are the most primitive type of reference
* **Density 1** -> 4 For this reason, a reference is often erroneously confused with a pointer or address, and is said to "point to" the data
* **Density 5** -> 3 Typically, for references to data stored in memory on a given system, a reference is implemented as the physical address of where the data is stored in memory or in the storage device
* **Density 6** -> 0In computer science, a reference is a value that enables a program to indirectly access a particular data, such as a variable's value or a record, in the computer's memory or in some other storage device

* **Density 6** -> 1 If your work has been tagged, please provide a reliable source for the statement, and discuss if needed
* **Density 3.8** -> 17 When adding a tag, ask yourself: Is it clear just what information you want cited? Is the information probably factual? (If it is not, then it needs deletion or correction rather than citation!) Is the knowledge so self-evident that it really does not need to be cited at all? (Some things do not
## Reference counting
* **Density 1** -> 4 Reference counting is also among the simplest forms of memory management to implement
* **Density 1.4** -> 0In computer science, reference counting is a programming technique of storing the number of references, pointers, or handles to a resource, such as an object, a block of memory, disk space, and others
* **Density 1.8** -> 19 Methods for dealing with this issue exist but can also increase the overhead and complexity of reference counting — on the other hand, these methods need only be applied to data that might form cycles, often a small subset of all data
* **Density 6** -> 2Advantages and disadvantagesThe main advantage of the reference counting over tracing garbage collection is that objects are reclaimed as soon as they can no longer be referenced, and in an incremental fashion, without long pauses for collection cycles and with clearly defined lifetime of every object
## Wikipedia:Citing sources

* **Density 6** -> 90 If a citation without an external link is challenged as unavailable, any of the following is sufficient to show the material to be reasonably available (though not necessarily reliable): providing an ISBN or OCLC number; linking to an established Wikipedia article about the source (the work, its author, or its publisher); or directly quoting the material on the talk page, briefly and in context
## Reserved word
* **Density 0.3** -> 1 This is a syntactic definition, and a reserved word may have no user-define meaning

* **Density 4.6** -> 6In general reserved words and keywords need not coincide, but in most modern languages keywords are a subset of reserved words, as this makes parsing easier, since keywords cannot be confused with identifiers
* **Density 6** -> 39 To prevent this and provide forward compatibility, sometimes words are reserved without having a current use (a reserved word that is not a keyword), as this allows the word to be used in future without breaking existing programs

## Strong and weak typing
* **Density 2.2** -> 0In computer programming, one of the many ways that programming languages are colloquially classified is whether the language's type system makes it strongly typed or weakly typed (loosely typed)

* **Density 1.4** -> 86 On February 21, 2012, it was announced that Twitter and Yandex agreed to a partnership
* **Density 2.2** -> 40 It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network
* **Density 3.8** -> 91In April 2012, Twitter announced that it was opening an office in Detroit, with the aim of working with automotive brands and advertising agencies
* **Density 4.6** -> 135 Analysis of the event revealed that the scammers had used social engineering to obtain credentials from Twitter employees to access an administration tool used by Twitter to view and change these accounts' personal details as to gain access as part of a "smash and grab" attempt to make money quickly, with an estimated US$120,000 in bitcoin deposited in various accounts before Twitter intervened

* **Density 2.2** -> 6OverviewType classes are defined by specifying a set of function or constant names, together with their respective types, that must exist for every type that belongs to the class
* **Density 6** -> 7 In Haskell, types can be parameterized; a type class Eq intended to contain types that admit equality would be declared in the following way:where a is one instance of the type class Eq, and a defines the function signatures for 2 functions (the equality and inequality functions), which each take 2 arguments of type a and return a boolean
## Type erasure
* **Density 3.8** -> 0In programming languages, type erasure is the load-time process by which explicit type annotations are removed from a program, before it is executed at run-time
* **Density 6** -> 2  The possibility of giving type-erasure semantics is a kind of abstraction principle, ensuring that the run-time execution of a program does not depend on type information

* **Density 1.8** -> 10Usage overviewAn example of a simple type system is that of the C language
* **Density 3.8** -> 4 The main purpose of a type system is to reduce possibilities for bugs in computer programs by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way
* **Density 6** -> 220 For example, in most implementations of C the signed char has range -128 to 127 and the unsigned char has range 0 to 255, so the intersection type of these two types would have range 0 to 127
## Typestate analysis
* **Density 0.4** -> 3 Typestates, as the name suggests, associate state information with variables of that type
* **Density 1** -> 2 Typestates define valid sequences of operations that can be performed upon an instance of a given type
* **Density 1.4** -> 4 This state information is used to determine at compile-time which operations are valid to be invoked upon an instance of the type

* **Density 1.4** -> 2In the C community, undefined behavior may be humorously referred to as "nasal demons", after a comp
* **Density 2.6** -> 0In computer programming, undefined behavior (UB) is the result of executing a program whose behavior is prescribed to be unpredictable, in the language specification to which the computer code adheres
* **Density 4.2** -> 13 The compiler can also remove explicit checks that may have been in the source code, without notifying the programmer; for example, detecting undefined behavior by testing whether it happened is not guaranteed to work, by definition
* **Density 6** -> 31An example for the C language:The value of x cannot be negative and, given that signed integer overflow is undefined behavior in C, the compiler can assume that value < 2147483600 will always be false
