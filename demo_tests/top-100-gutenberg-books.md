* **Density 3** -> In this state Iwas carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what hadhappened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something thatI had lost
* **Density 4** -> Thelabours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun orgentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted mydesolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made forthe enjoyment of pleasure
* **Density 5** -> “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenesof my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where thesnowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting blackand impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearancewere it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gayappearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind toreup whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must beon the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche andwhere their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of thenightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders
* **Density 6** -> Sometimes, indeed, I felt awish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my belovedcousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once morethe blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in earlychildhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which aprison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; andthese fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish anddespair

* **Density 2** ->      She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her      for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane,      whenever she might wish to talk again of either
* **Density 6** ->      To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement      to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it      would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more      spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley      and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his      notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much      distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed
* **Density 5** -> Darcy was expected there in the course of a few      weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom      she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively      new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused      in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him were, by his      behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by      Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest      satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration,      and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been      frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself
## The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle (26279)
* **Density 2** -> it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that myhair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that ifthere was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chanceas any man that I had ever met
* **Density 3** -> son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was knownto be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his ladshould step into the whole property
* **Density 6** -> I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of thiswound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, forit is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proofwith which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues whichI can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice willbe done
* **Density 5** -> Oh, sir, do you not think that you couldhelp me, too, and at least throw a little light through the densedarkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to rewardyou for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married,with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not findme ungrateful
## Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll (25495)
* **Density 2** -> a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, andshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming
* **Density 6** -> was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think itso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Ohdear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at thetime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took awatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurriedon, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that shehad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or awatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across thefield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down alarge rabbit-hole under the hedge

* **Density 2** -> She saw her ownface, glowing with girlish beauty, and illuminating all the interiorof the dusky mirror in which she had been wont to gaze at it
* **Density 3** -> He had slain men with his own hand, for aught Iknow,—certainly, they had fallen, like blades of grass at the sweepof the scythe, before the charge to which his spirit imparted itstriumphant energy;—but, be that as it might, there was never in hisheart so much cruelty as would have brushed the down off a butterfly’swing
* **Density 4** -> And may she feel, too,—what, methinks, isthe very truth,—that this boon was meant, above all things else, tokeep the mother’s soul alive, and to preserve her from blacker depthsof sin into which Satan might else have sought to plunge her!Therefore it is good for this poor, sinful woman that she hath aninfant immortality, a being capable of eternal joy or sorrow,confided to her care,—to be trained up by her to righteousness,—toremind her, at every moment, of her fall,—but yet to teach her, as itwere by the Creator’s sacred pledge, that, if she bring the child toheaven, the child also will bring its parent thither! Herein is thesinful mother happier than the sinful father
* **Density 5** -> If little Pearl were entertainedwith faith and trust, as a spirit messenger no less than an earthlychild, might it not be her errand to soothe away the sorrow that laycold in her mother’s heart, and converted it into a tomb?—and to helpher to overcome the passion, once so wild, and even yet neither deadnor asleep, but only imprisoned within the same tomb-like heart?Such were some of the thoughts that now stirred in Hester’s mind, withas much vivacity of impression as if they had actually been whisperedinto her ear
* **Density 6** -> Whether from commiseration for a woman of somiserable a destiny; or from the morbid curiosity that gives afictitious value even to common or worthless things; or by whateverother intangible circumstance was then, as now, sufficient to bestow,on some persons, what others might seek in vain; or because Hesterreally filled a gap which must otherwise have remained vacant; it iscertain that she had ready and fairly requited employment for as manyhours as she saw fit to occupy with her needle

* **Density 6** -> I wrote to theGovernment, and they sent back a pamphlet on the repair andmaintenance of frame houses
## A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens (20057)

* **Density 3** -> Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo on apillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiantsmile, “Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and toleave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!” those were nottears all of agony that wetted his young mother’s cheek, as the spiritdeparted from her embrace that had been entrusted to it
* **Density 4** -> Andso exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her whohad crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and whereshe now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been onlyraised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off andshut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him,trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm youngbreast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expressionrepeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that itlooked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her
* **Density 5** -> Stryver, massing his papers before him,whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glancedanxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, andgrouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat,and slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicionin the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one mansat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig puton just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal, hishands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been allday
* **Density 6** -> Defargehad but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserablewretch in a deadly embrace--Madame Defarge had but followed and turnedher hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied--The Vengeance andJacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windowshad not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their highperches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, “Bring himout! Bring him to the lamp!”Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, onhis knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck at,and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into hisface by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet alwaysentreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony ofaction, with a small clear space about him as the people drew oneanother back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn througha forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where oneof the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him go--as a catmight have done to a mouse--and silently and composedly looked at himwhile they made ready, and while he besought her: the women passionatelyscreeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling out to havehim killed with grass in his mouth

* **Density 2** -> He had justshaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and hewas most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room
* **Density 3** -> kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?”They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content
* **Density 4** -> This responsiveness had nothing to do with thatflabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the“creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, aromantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person andwhich it is not likely I shall ever find again
* **Density 5** -> he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had justbought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning
* **Density 6** -> up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little afterseven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddiesof people I didn’t know—though here and there was a face I had noticedon the commuting train

* **Density 2** -> Modest ProposalFor preventing the children of poor people in Ireland,from being a burden on their parents or country,and for making them beneficial to the publick
* **Density 6** -> It is true, a child just dropt from its dam, may besupported by her milk, for a solar year, with little other nourishment:at most not above the value of two shillings, which the mother maycertainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful occupation ofbegging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to providefor them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon theirparents, or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest oftheir lives, they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding,and partly to the clothing of many thousands
## Moby Dick; Or, The Whale by Herman Melville (19033)
* **Density 2** -> So strongly did he work upon hisdisciples among the crew, that at last in a body they went to thecaptain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man ofthem would remain
* **Density 3** -> Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what isman that he should live out the lifetime of his God?”He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face withhis hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed,and he was left alone in the place
* **Density 4** -> now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as thewhale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from hisbody being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at fromthe bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and whilethe other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisisimpossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious withthis tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive andhelpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seizedthe long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it fromits gripe
* **Density 5** -> Go visit the Prairies in June,when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep amongTiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a dropof water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travelyour thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, uponsuddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buyhim a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestriantrip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with arobust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such amystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now outof sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why didthe Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surelyall this is not without meaning
* **Density 6** -> I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that theCaptain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, andreceive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible byarriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged,and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if thecaptain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, hedoes not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her tothe owners till all is ready for sea

## The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (17669)
* **Density 2** -> was it all irretrievable? Was there no hope for him?Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed thatthe portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep theunsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due tothat
* **Density 3** -> He kept his hands in thepockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed thegesture with which he had been greeted
* **Density 4** -> He felt a terriblejoy at the thought that some one else was to share his secret, and thatthe man who had painted the portrait that was the origin of all hisshame was to be burdened for the rest of his life with the hideousmemory of what he had done
* **Density 5** -> was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birthand social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it wassaid that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into thesmoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and anothergentleman got up in a marked manner and went out
* **Density 6** -> And yet, who, that knew anything about life, would surrenderthe chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that chancemight be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught?Besides, was it really under his control? Had it indeed been prayerthat had produced the substitution? Might there not be some curiousscientific reason for it all? If thought could exercise its influenceupon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upondead and inorganic things? Nay, without thought or conscious desire,might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moodsand passions, atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity?But the reason was of no importance
## Dracula by Bram Stoker (16758)
* **Density 2** -> I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made awonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of orforesee
* **Density 3** -> He was surprised at myknowledge of the trains off-hand, but he does not know that I have madeup all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan incase he is in a hurry

Her face grew set in itslines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as sheanswered:--"Ah no! for my mind is made up!""To what?" he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each inour own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant
## The Importance of Being Earnest: A Trivial Comedy for Serious People by Oscar Wilde (16061)
* **Density 2** -> I have had very littleexperience of it myself up to the present
* **Density 6** -> And as a high moral tone can hardlybe said to conduce very much to either one’s health or one’s happiness,in order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a youngerbrother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets intothe most dreadful scrapes
## Great Expectations by Charles Dickens (15762)
* **Density 2** -> We had got to thetop of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanicalappearance, and that he was not smiling at all
* **Density 3** -> For all that I knew this perfectly well, I stillfelt as if it were not safe to let the coach-office be out of my sightlonger than five minutes at a time; and in this condition of unreason Ihad performed the first half-hour of a watch of four or five hours,when Wemmick ran against me
* **Density 4** -> I knewthat when I was changed into a part of the vapour that had crepttowards me but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, hewould do as he had done in my sister’s case,—make all haste to thetown, and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses
* **Density 6** -> said Estella,—“which is a nearer case,—if you had taught her,from the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might,that there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be herenemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it hadblighted you and would else blight her;—if you had done this, and then,for a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and shecould not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?”Miss Havisham sat listening (or it seemed so, for I could not see herface), but still made no answer

## The Prince by Niccolò Machiavelli (14551)
* **Density 2** -> This would make his position more secure and durable, as it hasmade that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the othermeasures taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settledthere, would not have been able to keep it
* **Density 5** -> And firstly, if it benot entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, takencollectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly froman inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; formen change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, andthis hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: whereinthey are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they havegone from bad to worse
* **Density 6** -> And I knowthat every one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in aprince to exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; butbecause they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for humanconditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficientlyprudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices whichwould lose him his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible,from those which would not lose him it; but this not being possible, hemay with less hesitation abandon himself to them
## Jane Eyre: An Autobiography by Charlotte Brontë (14421)
* **Density 2** -> looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it wasardent and flushed
* **Density 4** -> Rochester: Icould not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased tonotice me—because I might pass hours in his presence, and he wouldnever once turn his eyes in my direction—because I saw all hisattentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me withthe hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperiouseye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an objecttoo mean to merit observation
* **Density 6** -> I was notingthese things and enjoying them as a child might, when it entered mymind as it had never done before:—“How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!This world is pleasant—it would be dreary to be called from it, and tohave to go who knows where?”And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what hadbeen infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first timeit recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on eachside, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt theone point where it stood—the present; all the rest was formless cloudand vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, andplunging amid that chaos

* **Density 6** -> But Marlow was not typical (ifhis propensity to spin yarns be excepted), and to him the meaning of anepisode was not inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the talewhich brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likenessof one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible by thespectral illumination of moonshine
## The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson (14010)
* **Density 3** -> Utterson; for he was undemonstrativeat the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similarcatholicity of good-nature
* **Density 6** -> The next thing was to getthe money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place withthe door?—whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with thematter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts’s,drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can’t mention,though it’s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at leastvery well known and often printed
## Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (13419)
* **Density 2** -> But when he had at lastgot his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to himthat if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were notinjured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward thesame way
* **Density 6** -> Why did Gregor have to be theonly one condemned to work for a company where they immediately becamehighly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees,every one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithfuland devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that hecouldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least a couple of hoursin the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let oneof the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were evennecessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they haveto show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious thatonly the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigateit? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through anyproper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed
## Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky (13289)
* **Density 4** -> At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all ofa sudden he stood on his dignity: ‘how,’ said he, ‘can a highly educatedman like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?’ And KaterinaIvanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her
* **Density 3** -> And now look there: I don’t know that dandy with whom Iwas going to fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seenher on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is doing, and nowhe is very eager to get hold of her, to get her away somewhere while sheis in this state
* **Density 6** -> That’s what betrays him! Another time he will be carriedaway by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him, hewill turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead, but his paleness willbe _too natural_, too much like the real thing, again he has given usan idea! Though his questioner may be deceived at first, he will thinkdifferently next day if he is not a fool, and, of course, it is likethat at every step! He puts himself forward where he is not wanted,speaks continually when he ought to keep silent, brings in all sorts ofallegorical allusions, he-he! Comes and asks why didn’t you take me longago? he-he-he! And that can happen, you know, with the cleverest man,the psychologist, the literary man

* **Density 4** -> She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, herown colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere onher because the green she wore that day week brought grief because hisfather brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition andbecause she thought perhaps he might be out because when she wasdressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her insideout and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those thingson inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you solong as it wasn’t of a Friday
* **Density 5** -> though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of hisbosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it(while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration fora man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courageof his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be aparty to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas ofthe south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently,after some words passed between the two concerning her relations withthe other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflictedfatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternativepostnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it juststruck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car forthe actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he wasreliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point offact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on
* **Density 6** -> Nevertheless, without goinginto the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained thatthe sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of thingssomebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providencethough it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load thatsort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lotteryand insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that forthat very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudableinstitution to which the public at large, no matter where living inlandor seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them likethat should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters andcoastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amidthe elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects thatevery man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in thewintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable tocapsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter hadexperienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather

* **Density 3** -> Ihad everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as hewould a done at home--better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I_was_, with both of 'm on my hands, and there I had to stick till aboutdawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luckwould have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head proppedon his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slippedup on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he wasabout, and we never had no trouble
* **Density 6** -> was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and wentover the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took alook at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper,and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn't know which end theywas standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was donesupper, and wouldn't tell us what the trouble was, and never let on aword about the new letter, but didn't need to, because we knowed as muchabout it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and herback was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a goodlunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up abouthalf-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally's dress that he stole andwas going to start with the lunch, but says:“Where's the butter?”“I laid out a hunk of it,” I says, “on a piece of a corn-pone
* **Density 5** -> then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched hercandle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and likeI couldn't look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talkedwith me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn'tseem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me everynow and then if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybedrownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering ordead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip downsilent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be homein the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me,and tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done hergood, and she was in so much trouble

Let Curdken’s hat go!  Blow, breezes, blow!  Let him after it go!  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,  Away be it whirl’d  Till the silvery locks  Are all comb’d and curl’d!Then the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,over the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and whenhe came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe
* **Density 5** -> bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up thestone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and tookthe stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to thetree and sang-- ‘My mother killed her little son;  My father grieved when I was gone;  My sister loved me best of all;  She laid her kerchief over me,  And took my bones that they might lie  Underneath the juniper-tree  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’And when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with thechain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone roundhis neck, he flew right away to his father’s house
* **Density 6** -> And when shecame to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down herwaving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdkensaw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of thelocks out, but she cried: ‘Blow, breezes, blow!

* **Density 2** -> The scene is on the banks and in the stream    of Scamander
* **Density 3** -> from whose lips divine persuasion flows,Grave Nestor, then, in graceful act arose;Thus to the kings he spoke: “What grief, what shameAttend on Greece, and all the Grecian name!How shall, alas! her hoary heroes mournTheir sons degenerate, and their race a scorn!What tears shall down thy silvery beard be roll’d,O Peleus, old in arms, in wisdom old!Once with what joy the generous prince would hearOf every chief who fought this glorious war,Participate their fame, and pleased inquireEach name, each action, and each hero’s sire!Gods! should he see our warriors trembling stand,And trembling all before one hostile hand;How would he lift his aged arms on high,Lament inglorious Greece, and beg to die!Oh! would to all the immortal powers above,Minerva, Phœbus, and almighty Jove!Years might again roll back, my youth renew,And give this arm the spring which once it knewWhen fierce in war, where Jardan’s waters fall,I led my troops to Phea’s trembling wall,And with the Arcadian spears my prowess tried,Where Celadon rolls down his rapid tide
* **Density 4** -> on his rattling chariot Hector came:His eyes like Gorgon shot a sanguine flameThat wither’d all their host: like Mars he stood:Dire as the monster, dreadful as the god!Their strong distress the wife of Jove survey’d;Then pensive thus, to war’s triumphant maid:“O daughter of that god, whose arm can wieldThe avenging bolt, and shake the sable shield!Now, in this moment of her last despair,Shall wretched Greece no more confess our care,Condemn’d to suffer the full force of fate,And drain the dregs of heaven’s relentless hate?Gods! shall one raging hand thus level all?What numbers fell! what numbers yet shall fall!What power divine shall Hector’s wrath assuage?Still swells the slaughter, and still grows the rage!”So spake the imperial regent of the skies;To whom the goddess with the azure eyes:“Long since had Hector stain’d these fields with gore,Stretch’d by some Argive on his native shore:But he above, the sire of heaven, withstands,Mocks our attempts, and slights our just demands;The stubborn god, inflexible and hard,Forgets my service and deserved reward:Saved I, for this, his favourite son distress’d,By stern Eurystheus with long labours press’d?He begg’d, with tears he begg’d, in deep dismay;I shot from heaven, and gave his arm the day
* **Density 5** -> weighty talents of the purest gold,And twice ten vases of refulgent mould;Seven sacred tripods, whose unsullied frameYet knows no office, nor has felt the flame;Twelve steeds unmatched in fleetness and in force,And still victorious in the dusty course;(Rich were the man, whose ample stores exceedThe prizes purchased by their winged speed;)Seven lovely captives of the Lesbian line,Skill’d in each art, unmatch’d in form divine,The same he chose for more than vulgar charms,When Lesbos sank beneath thy conquering arms
* **Density 6** -> Jove descending shook the Idaean hills,And down their summits pour’d a hundred rills:The unkindled lightning in his hand he took,And thus the many-coloured maid bespoke:“Iris, with haste thy golden wings display,To godlike Hector this our word convey—While Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,Fights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,Bid him give way; but issue forth commands,And trust the war to less important hands:But when, or wounded by the spear or dart,That chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,Then Jove shall string his arm, and fire his breast,Then to her ships shall flying Greece be press’d,Till to the main the burning sun descend,And sacred night her awful shade extend
## Simple Sabotage Field Manual by United States. Office of Strategic Services (11657)
* **Density 2** -> Occurring on awide scale, simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on thewar effort of the enemy
* **Density 6** -> sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment;it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not actindividually and without the necessity for active connection with anorganized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve aminimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal
## Walden, and On The Duty Of Civil Disobedience by Henry David Thoreau (11286)
* **Density 2** -> I have neverfelt lonesome, or in the least oppressed by a sense of solitude, butonce, and that was a few weeks after I came to the woods, when, for anhour, I doubted if the near neighborhood of man was not essential to aserene and healthy life
* **Density 3** -> was formerly the custom in our village, when a poor debtor came outof jail, for his acquaintances to salute him, looking through theirfingers, which were crossed to represent the grating of a jail window,“How do ye do?” My neighbors did not thus salute me, but first lookedat me, and then at one another, as if I had returned from a longjourney
* **Density 4** -> However, _I_ shouldnever have broken a horse or bull and taken him to board for any workhe might do for me, for fear I should become a horse-man or a herds-manmerely; and if society seems to be the gainer by so doing, are wecertain that what is one man’s gain is not another’s loss, and that thestable-boy has equal cause with his master to be satisfied? Grantedthat some public works would not have been constructed without thisaid, and let man share the glory of such with the ox and horse; does itfollow that he could not have accomplished works yet more worthy ofhimself in that case? When men begin to do, not merely unnecessary orartistic, but luxurious and idle work, with their assistance, it isinevitable that a few do all the exchange work with the oxen, or, inother words, become the slaves of the strongest
* **Density 5** -> I tried to help him with my experience, telling himthat he was one of my nearest neighbors, and that I too, who camea-fishing here, and looked like a loafer, was getting my living likehimself; that I lived in a tight, light, and clean house, which hardlycost more than the annual rent of such a ruin as his commonly amountsto; and how, if he chose, he might in a month or two build himself apalace of his own; that I did not use tea, nor coffee, nor butter, normilk, nor fresh meat, and so did not have to work to get them; again,as I did not work hard, I did not have to eat hard, and it cost me buta trifle for my food; but as he began with tea, and coffee, and butter,and milk, and beef, he had to work hard to pay for them, and when hehad worked hard he had to eat hard again to repair the waste of hissystem,—and so it was as broad as it was long, indeed it was broaderthan it was long, for he was discontented and wasted his life into thebargain; and yet he had rated it as a gain in coming to America, thathere you could get tea, and coffee, and meat every day
* **Density 6** -> If Ishould only give a few pulls at the parish bell-rope, as for a fire,that is, without setting the bell, there is hardly a man on his farm inthe outskirts of Concord, notwithstanding that press of engagementswhich was his excuse so many times this morning, nor a boy, nor awoman, I might almost say, but would forsake all and follow that sound,not mainly to save property from the flames, but, if we will confessthe truth, much more to see it burn, since burn it must, and we, be itknown, did not set it on fire,—or to see it put out, and have a hand init, if that is done as handsomely; yes, even if it were the parishchurch itself
## The Souls of Black Folk by W. E. B.  Du Bois (10590)
* **Density 2** -> He simply wishes to make it possible for a manto be both a Negro and an American, without being cursed and spit uponby his fellows, without having the doors of Opportunity closed roughlyin his face
* **Density 3** -> only is this true in the world which Atlanta typifies, but it isthreatening to be true of a world beneath and beyond that world,—theBlack World beyond the Veil
* **Density 4** -> Who would do it if Negroes did not? How could Negroesdo it if they were not trained carefully for it? If white people needcolleges to furnish teachers, ministers, lawyers, and doctors, do blackpeople need nothing of the sort?If it is true that there are an appreciable number of Negro youth inthe land capable by character and talent to receive that highertraining, the end of which is culture, and if the two and a halfthousand who have had something of this training in the past have inthe main proved themselves useful to their race and generation, thequestion then comes, What place in the future development of the Southought the Negro college and college-bred man to occupy? That thepresent social separation and acute race-sensitiveness must eventuallyyield to the influences of culture, as the South grows civilized, isclear
* **Density 5** -> invaluable service in counselling patience and courtesy insuch demands; they do not ask that ignorant black men vote whenignorant whites are debarred, or that any reasonable restrictions inthe suffrage should not be applied; they know that the low social levelof the mass of the race is responsible for much discrimination againstit, but they also know, and the nation knows, that relentlesscolor-prejudice is more often a cause than a result of the Negro’sdegradation; they seek the abatement of this relic of barbarism, andnot its systematic encouragement and pampering by all agencies ofsocial power from the Associated Press to the Church of Christ
* **Density 6** -> Herestands this black young Atalanta, girding herself for the race thatmust be run; and if her eyes be still toward the hills and sky as inthe days of old, then we may look for noble running; but what if someruthless or wily or even thoughtless Hippomenes lay golden applesbefore her? What if the Negro people be wooed from a strife forrighteousness, from a love of knowing, to regard dollars as the be-alland end-all of life? What if to the Mammonism of America be added therising Mammonism of the re-born South, and the Mammonism of this Southbe reinforced by the budding Mammonism of its half-wakened blackmillions? Whither, then, is the new-world quest of Goodness and Beautyand Truth gone glimmering? Must this, and that fair flower of Freedomwhich, despite the jeers of latter-day striplings, sprung from ourfathers’ blood, must that too degenerate into a dusty quest ofgold,—into lawless lust with Hippomenes?The hundred hills of Atlanta are not all crowned with factories
## Little Women by Louisa May Alcott (10285)
* **Density 2** -> Ithink well of him, and like to show that I do, for he is a gentleman inspite of the brown paper parcels
* **Density 3** -> It all grew outof a cocked hat, for one evening the Professor came in to give Jo herlesson with a paper soldier cap on his head, which Tina had put thereand he had forgotten to take off
* **Density 4** -> I haven’t given up the hope that I maywrite a good book yet, but I can wait, and I’m sure it will be all thebetter for such experiences and illustrations as these,” and Jo pointedfrom the lively lads in the distance to her father, leaning on theProfessor’s arm, as they walked to and fro in the sunshine, deep in oneof the conversations which both enjoyed so much, and then to hermother, sitting enthroned among her daughters, with their children inher lap and at her feet, as if all found help and happiness in the facewhich never could grow old to them
* **Density 5** -> With her pretty hair tucked into a little cap, arms bared to theelbow, and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of thebib, the young housewife fell to work, feeling no doubts about hersuccess, for hadn’t she seen Hannah do it hundreds of times? The arrayof pots rather amazed her at first, but John was so fond of jelly, andthe nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf, that Megresolved to fill them all, and spent a long day picking, boiling,straining, and fussing over her jelly
* **Density 6** -> A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners, much talent,and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying toget other people out of them, he stood in great danger of beingspoiled, and probably would have been, like many another promising boy,if he had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of thekind old man who was bound up in his success, the motherly friend whowatched over him as if he were her son, and last, but not least by anymeans, the knowledge that four innocent girls loved, admired, andbelieved in him with all their hearts
## Around the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne (9990)
* **Density 2** -> The road, then, was quite clear ofobstacles, and Phileas Fogg had but two things to fear—an accident tothe sledge, and a change or calm in the wind
* **Density 3** -> Mudge, who was at the rudder, kept in a straight line,and by a turn of his hand checked the lurches which the vehicle had atendency to make
* **Density 4** -> He might, perhaps, reckon on the arrival of trains atthe designated hours, in Europe, where the distances were relativelymoderate; but when he calculated upon crossing India in three days, andthe United States in seven, could he rely beyond misgiving uponaccomplishing his task? There were accidents to machinery, theliability of trains to run off the line, collisions, bad weather, theblocking up by snow—were not all these against Phileas Fogg? Would henot find himself, when travelling by steamer in winter, at the mercy ofthe winds and fogs? Is it uncommon for the best ocean steamers to betwo or three days behind time? But a single delay would suffice tofatally break the chain of communication; should Phileas Fogg oncemiss, even by an hour; a steamer, he would have to wait for the next,and that would irrevocably render his attempt vain
* **Density 6** -> Fogg had accomplished the journey round the world in eightydays!Phileas Fogg had won his wager of twenty thousand pounds!How was it that a man so exact and fastidious could have made thiserror of a day? How came he to think that he had arrived in London onSaturday, the twenty-first day of December, when it was really Friday,the twentieth, the seventy-ninth day only from his departure?The cause of the error is very simple
## War and Peace by graf Leo Tolstoy (9760)
* **Density 2** -> Itwas a unique chance to show his devotion to the Emperor and he had notmade use of it
* **Density 3** -> I just heated a ruler in thefire and pressed it there!”Sitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms, in what usedto be his old schoolroom, and looking into Natásha’s wildly brighteyes, Rostóv re-entered that world of home and childhood which had nomeaning for anyone else, but gave him some of the best joys of his life;and the burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of love did not seemto him senseless, he understood and was not surprised at it
* **Density 4** -> could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel atthe next vacancy, for his mother now clung to him as her one hold onlife; and so despite his reluctance to remain in Moscow among people whohad known him before, and despite his abhorrence of the civil service,he accepted a post in Moscow in that service, doffed the uniform ofwhich he was so fond, and moved with his mother and Sónya to a smallhouse on the Sívtsev Vrazhók
* **Density 5** -> When he listened to, orhimself took part in, trivial conversations, when he read or heard ofhuman baseness or folly, he was not horrified as formerly, and didnot ask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is sotransient and incomprehensible—but he remembered her as he had lastseen her, and all his doubts vanished—not because she had answeredthe questions that had haunted him, but because his conception of hertransferred him instantly to another, a brighter, realm of spiritualactivity in which no one could be justified or guilty—a realm of beautyand love which it was worth living for
* **Density 6** -> would Sónya and the count and countess have done, how would theyhave looked, if nothing had been done, if there had not been those pillsto give by the clock, the warm drinks, the chicken cutlets, and all theother details of life ordered by the doctors, the carrying out of whichsupplied an occupation and consolation to the family circle? How wouldthe count have borne his dearly loved daughter’s illness had he notknown that it was costing him a thousand rubles, and that he would notgrudge thousands more to benefit her, or had he not known that if herillness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and would takeher abroad for consultations there, and had he not been able to explainthe details of how Métivier and Feller had not understood the symptoms,but Frise had, and Múdrov had diagnosed them even better? What would thecountess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalidfor not strictly obeying the doctor’s orders?“You’ll never get well like that,” she would say, forgetting her griefin her vexation, “if you won’t obey the doctor and take your medicine atthe right time! You mustn’t trifle with it, you know, or it may turn topneumonia,” she would go on, deriving much comfort from the utterance ofthat foreign word, incomprehensible to others as well as to herself
## The Count of Monte Cristo, Illustrated by Alexandre Dumas (9737)
* **Density 2** -> Noirtier sent for the notary; the first will was tornup and a second made, in which he left the whole of his fortune toValentine, on condition that she should never be separated from him
* **Density 3** -> Would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret?Would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that I had notdied from the blow of his dagger? It was therefore necessary, beforeeverything else, and at all risks, that I should cause all traces ofthe past to disappear—that I should destroy every material vestige; toomuch reality would always remain in my recollection
* **Density 4** -> it were otherwise—if he treated me diplomatically—that is to say,like a man who wishes, by some means or other, to obtain a footing inthe house, so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to itsoccupants—he would, if it had been but once, have honored me with thesmile which you extol so loudly; but no, he saw that I was unhappy, heunderstood that I could be of no use to him, and therefore paid noattention to me whatever
* **Density 5** -> What matters this punishment, as long as he is avenged?On my word, I almost regret that in all probability this miserablePeppino will not be beheaded, as you might have had an opportunity thenof seeing how short a time the punishment lasts, and whether it isworth even mentioning; but, really this is a most singular conversationfor the Carnival, gentlemen; how did it arise? Ah, I recollect, youasked for a place at my window; you shall have it; but let us first sitdown to table, for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfastis ready
* **Density 6** -> often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear friend—afriend lost to him forever; and on his death-bed, when the nearapproach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind withsupernatural light, this thought, which had until then been but adoubt, became a conviction, and his last words were, ‘Maximilian, itwas Edmond Dantès!’”At these words the count’s paleness, which had for some time beenincreasing, became alarming; he could not speak; he looked at his watchlike a man who has forgotten the hour, said a few hurried words toMadame Herbault, and pressing the hands of Emmanuel andMaximilian,—“Madame,” said he, “I trust you will allow me to visit youoccasionally; I value your friendship, and feel grateful to you foryour welcome, for this is the first time for many years that I havethus yielded to my feelings;” and he hastily quitted the apartment
## The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky (9285)
* **Density 2** -> But for a long while Ivan didnot recognize the real cause of his growing dislike and he had onlylately realized what was at the root of it
* **Density 3** -> But yet all his life he loved humanity, andsuddenly his eyes were opened, and he saw that it is no great moralblessedness to attain perfection and freedom, if at the same time onegains the conviction that millions of God’s creatures have been createdas a mockery, that they will never be capable of using their freedom,that these poor rebels can never turn into giants to complete thetower, that it was not for such geese that the great idealist dreamthis dream of harmony
* **Density 5** -> I accuse, but I defend also!’ He exclaimed thatseveral times, but forgot to mention that if this terrible prisoner wasfor twenty‐three years so grateful for a mere pound of nuts given himby the only man who had been kind to him, as a child in his father’shouse, might not such a man well have remembered for twenty‐three yearshow he ran in his father’s back‐yard, ‘without boots on his feet andwith his little trousers hanging by one button’—to use the expressionof the kind‐hearted doctor, Herzenstube?“Oh, gentlemen of the jury, why need we look more closely at thismisfortune, why repeat what we all know already? What did my clientmeet with when he arrived here, at his father’s house, and why depictmy client as a heartless egoist and monster? He is uncontrolled, he iswild and unruly—we are trying him now for that—but who is responsiblefor his life? Who is responsible for his having received such anunseemly bringing up, in spite of his excellent disposition and hisgrateful and sensitive heart? Did any one train him to be reasonable?Was he enlightened by study? Did any one love him ever so little in hischildhood? My client was left to the care of Providence like a beast ofthe field
* **Density 6** -> Canyou conceive that a man like that, on receiving that sum and in such away, at the price of such shame, such disgrace, such utter degradation,could have been capable that very day of setting apart half that sum,that very day, and sewing it up in a little bag, and would have had thefirmness of character to carry it about with him for a whole monthafterwards, in spite of every temptation and his extreme need of it!Neither in drunken debauchery in taverns, nor when he was flying intothe country, trying to get from God knows whom, the money so essentialto him to remove the object of his affections from being tempted by hisfather, did he bring himself to touch that little bag! Why, if only toavoid abandoning his mistress to the rival of whom he was so jealous,he would have been certain to have opened that bag and to have stayedat home to keep watch over her, and to await the moment when she wouldsay to him at last ‘I am yours,’ and to fly with her far from theirfatal surroundings

* **Density 3** -> his arms were so stiff from holding on to the string of the balloonall that time that they stayed up straight in the air for more than aweek, and whenever a fly came and settled on his nose he had to blow itoff
* **Density 6** -> you both went out with the blue balloon, and you took your gunwith you, just in case, as you always did, and Winnie-the-Pooh went to avery muddy place that he knew of, and rolled and rolled until he wasblack all over; and then, when the balloon was blown up as big as big,and you and Pooh were both holding on to the string, you let gosuddenly, and Pooh Bear floated gracefully up into the sky, and stayedthere--level with the top of the tree and about twenty feet away fromit

* **Density 4** -> Heavens, waseverything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when a mancleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck’s heart shot into histhroat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking asif a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that hethought he must surely fall to the ground
* **Density 5** -> He made a plausibleexcuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secretwould keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he hadmeant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction
* **Density 6** -> Tom lay upona sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of thewonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn itwithal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and wenton an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as hiskite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretchof the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-offspeck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it,pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broadMississippi rolling by!And if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen thatspeck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! Hetold how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she toldhim not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she wasgoing to die, and wanted to
## The Republic by Plato (9102)
* **Density 2** -> And God proclaims as a first principle to the rulers, and aboveall else, that there is nothing which they should so anxiously guard,or of which they are to be such good guardians, as of the purity of therace
* **Density 3** -> understand; you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which weare the founders, and which exists in idea only; for I do not believethat there is such an one anywhere on earth?In heaven, I replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks, whichhe who desires may behold, and beholding, may set his own house inorder
* **Density 4** -> I said, and you would agree (would you not?) that what has beensaid about the State and the government is not a mere dream, andalthough difficult not impossible, but only possible in the way whichhas been supposed; that is to say, when the true philosopher kings areborn in a State, one or more of them, despising the honours of thispresent world which they deem mean and worthless, esteeming above allthings right and the honour that springs from right, and regardingjustice as the greatest and most necessary of all things, whoseministers they are, and whose principles will be exalted by them whenthey set in order their own city?How will they proceed?They will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants ofthe city who are more than ten years old, and will take possession oftheir children, who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents;these they will train in their own habits and laws, I mean in the lawswhich we have given them: and in this way the State and constitution ofwhich we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness,and the nation which has such a constitution will gain most
* **Density 5** -> And oftenrulers and their subjects may come in one another’s way, whether on ajourney or on some other occasion of meeting, on a pilgrimage or amarch, as fellow-soldiers or fellow-sailors; aye and they may observethe behaviour of each other in the very moment of danger—for wheredanger is, there is no fear that the poor will be despised by therich—and very likely the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battleat the side of a wealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion andhas plenty of superfluous flesh—when he sees such an one puffing and athis wits’-end, how can he avoid drawing the conclusion that men likehim are only rich because no one has the courage to despoil them?

* **Density 6** -> in reality justice was such as we were describing, being concernedhowever, not with the outward man, but with the inward, which is thetrue self and concernment of man: for the just man does not permit theseveral elements within him to interfere with one another, or any ofthem to do the work of others,—he sets in order his own inner life, andis his own master and his own law, and at peace with himself; and whenhe has bound together the three principles within him, which may becompared to the higher, lower, and middle notes of the scale, and theintermediate intervals—when he has bound all these together, and is nolonger many, but has become one entirely temperate and perfectlyadjusted nature, then he proceeds to act, if he has to act, whether ina matter of property, or in the treatment of the body, or in someaffair of politics or private business; always thinking and callingthat which preserves and co-operates with this harmonious condition,just and good action, and the knowledge which presides over it, wisdom,and that which at any time impairs this condition, he will call unjustaction, and the opinion which presides over it ignorance

Tell me also ifyou have heard anything about my father Peleus—does he still rule amongthe Myrmidons, or do they show him no respect throughout Hellas andPhthia now that he is old and his limbs fail him?

* **Density 4** -> Rule, By Which The Laws Of Nature May Easily Be ExaminedAnd though this may seem too subtile a deduction of the Lawes of Nature,to be taken notice of by all men; whereof the most part are too busie ingetting food, and the rest too negligent to understand; yet to leaveall men unexcusable, they have been contracted into one easie sum,intelligible even to the meanest capacity; and that is, "Do not that toanother, which thou wouldest not have done to thy selfe;" which shewethhim, that he has no more to do in learning the Lawes of Nature, but,when weighing the actions of other men with his own, they seem tooheavy, to put them into the other part of the ballance, and his own intotheir place, that his own passions, and selfe-love, may adde nothing tothe weight; and then there is none of these Lawes of Nature that willnot appear unto him very reasonable
* **Density 5** -> nature of Sight having never been discovered by the ancientpretenders to Naturall Knowledge; much lesse by those that consider notthings so remote (as that Knowledge is) from their present use; it washard for men to conceive of those Images in the Fancy, and in the Sense,otherwise, than of things really without us: Which some (because theyvanish away, they know not whither, nor how,) will have to be absolutelyIncorporeall, that is to say Immateriall, of Formes without Matter;Colour and Figure, without any coloured or figured Body; and that theycan put on Aiery bodies (as a garment) to make them Visible whenthey will to our bodily Eyes; and others say, are Bodies, and livingCreatures, but made of Air, or other more subtile and aethereall Matter,which is, then, when they will be seen, condensed

* **Density 4** -> He then grew serious, and desired to ask me freely,“whether I were not troubled in my mind by the consciousness of someenormous crime, for which I was punished, at the command of someprince, by exposing me in that chest; as great criminals, in othercountries, have been forced to sea in a leaky vessel, withoutprovisions: for although he should be sorry to have taken so ill a maninto his ship, yet he would engage his word to set me safe ashore, inthe first port where we arrived
* **Density 5** -> two or three days before I was set at liberty, as I wasentertaining the court with this kind of feat, there arrived an expressto inform his majesty, that some of his subjects, riding near the placewhere I was first taken up, had seen a great black substance lying onthe ground, very oddly shaped, extending its edges round, as wide ashis majesty’s bedchamber, and rising up in the middle as high as a man;that it was no living creature, as they at first apprehended, for itlay on the grass without motion; and some of them had walked round itseveral times; that, by mounting upon each other’s shoulders, they hadgot to the top, which was flat and even, and, stamping upon it, theyfound that it was hollow within; that they humbly conceived it might besomething belonging to the man-mountain; and if his majesty pleased,they would undertake to bring it with only five horses
* **Density 6** -> He added, how I had endeavoured to persuade him, that inmy own and other countries, the _Yahoos_ acted as the governing,rational animal, and held the _Houyhnhnms_ in servitude; that heobserved in me all the qualities of a _Yahoo_, only a little morecivilized by some tincture of reason, which, however, was in a degreeas far inferior to the _Houyhnhnm_ race, as the _Yahoos_ of theircountry were to me; that, among other things, I mentioned a custom wehad of castrating _Houyhnhnms_ when they were young, in order to renderthem tame; that the operation was easy and safe; that it was no shameto learn wisdom from brutes, as industry is taught by the ant, andbuilding by the swallow (for so I translate the word _lyhannh_,although it be a much larger fowl); that this invention might bepractised upon the younger _Yahoos_ here, which besides rendering themtractable and fitter for use, would in an age put an end to the wholespecies, without destroying life; that in the mean time the_Houyhnhnms_ should be exhorted to cultivate the breed of asses, which,as they are in all respects more valuable brutes, so they have thisadvantage, to be fit for service at five years old, which the othersare not till twelve

* **Density 3** ->  The serviceis a reflection of what it was in the old temple, and what, under thevenerable vicar, it is intended to be in the new

* **Density 3** -> It was said, too, that he had builthis brick-kiln in the same way, and that the workmen were on the citypayroll while they did it; however, one had to press closely to getthese things out of the men, for it was not their business, and MikeScully was a good man to stand in with
* **Density 4** -> He laughed tohimself as he thought how he would hang on to this job!And then one afternoon, the ninth of his work in the place, when hewent to get his overcoat he saw a group of men crowded before a placardon the door, and when he went over and asked what it was, they told himthat beginning with the morrow his department of the harvester workswould be closed until further notice!CHAPTER XXIThat was the way they did it! There was not half an hour’s warning—theworks were closed! It had happened that way before, said the men, andit would happen that way forever
* **Density 5** -> Andnow, with this last hideous injustice, its time had come, and it hadturned them out bag and baggage, and taken their house and sold itagain! And they could do nothing, they were tied hand and foot—the lawwas against them, the whole machinery of society was at theiroppressors’ command! If Jurgis so much as raised a hand against them,back he would go into that wild-beast pen from which he had justescaped!To get up and go away was to give up, to acknowledge defeat, to leavethe strange family in possession; and Jurgis might have sat shiveringin the rain for hours before he could do that, had it not been for thethought of his family
* **Density 6** -> There were mishaps anddiscomforts—but at least there was always something new; and only thinkwhat it meant to a man who for years had been penned up in one place,seeing nothing but one dreary prospect of shanties and factories, to besuddenly set loose beneath the open sky, to behold new landscapes, newplaces, and new people every hour! To a man whose whole life hadconsisted of doing one certain thing all day, until he was so exhaustedthat he could only lie down and sleep until the next day—and to be nowhis own master, working as he pleased and when he pleased, and facing anew adventure every hour!Then, too, his health came back to him, all his lost youthful vigor,his joy and power that he had mourned and forgotten! It came with asudden rush, bewildering him, startling him; it was as if his deadchildhood had come back to him, laughing and calling! What with plentyto eat and fresh air and exercise that was taken as it pleased him, hewould waken from his sleep and start off not knowing what to do withhis energy, stretching his arms, laughing, singing old songs of homethat came back to him
## Beyond Good and Evil by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (6406)
* **Density 2** -> And could it be believed that it at last seems to us asif the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the firstto discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it? For there is riskin raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk
* **Density 4** -> MAGNUS)PREFACESUPPOSING that Truth is a woman--what then? Is there not groundfor suspecting that all philosophers, in so far as they have beendogmatists, have failed to understand women--that the terribleseriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paidtheir addresses to Truth, have been unskilled and unseemly methods forwinning a woman? Certainly she has never allowed herself to be won; andat present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien--IF,indeed, it stands at all! For there are scoffers who maintain that ithas fallen, that all dogma lies on the ground--nay more, that it is atits last gasp
* **Density 6** -> In that they sideAGAINST appearance, and speak superciliously of "perspective," inthat they rank the credibility of their own bodies about as low as thecredibility of the ocular evidence that "the earth stands still," andthus, apparently, allowing with complacency their securest possessionto escape (for what does one at present believe in more firmly thanin one's body?),--who knows if they are not really trying to win backsomething which was formerly an even securer possession, somethingof the old domain of the faith of former times, perhaps the "immortalsoul," perhaps "the old God," in short, ideas by which they could livebetter, that is to say, more vigorously and more joyously, than by"modern ideas"? There is DISTRUST of these modern ideas in this modeof looking at things, a disbelief in all that has been constructedyesterday and today; there is perhaps some slight admixture of satietyand scorn, which can no longer endure the BRIC-A-BRAC of ideas of themost varied origin, such as so-called Positivism at present throws onthe market; a disgust of the more refined taste at the village-fairmotleyness and patchiness of all these reality-philosophasters, in whomthere is nothing either new or true, except this motleyness
## Les Misérables by Victor Hugo (6396)
* **Density 2** -> He had a gun which he used better than any one else in theworld, he was a bit of a poacher, and this injured his case
* **Density 3** -> that moment, he for the first time indulged in this reflection,thinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner: thatall this trouble which he was taking was, perhaps, useless; that he didnot know so much as the hour of the trial; that he should, at least,have informed himself of that; that he was foolish to go thus straightahead without knowing whether he would be of any service or not; thenhe sketched out some calculations in his mind: that, ordinarily, thesittings of the Court of Assizes began at nine o’clock in the morning;that it could not be a long affair; that the theft of the apples wouldbe very brief; that there would then remain only a question ofidentity, four or five depositions, and very little for the lawyers tosay; that he should arrive after all was over
* **Density 4** -> hour when history speaks with its free and venerable accent, hasnot yet sounded for him; the moment has not come to pronounce adefinite judgment on this king; the austere and illustrious historianLouis Blanc has himself recently softened his first verdict; LouisPhilippe was elected by those two _almosts_ which are called the 221and 1830, that is to say, by a half-Parliament, and a half-revolution;and in any case, from the superior point of view where philosophy mustplace itself, we cannot judge him here, as the reader has seen above,except with certain reservations in the name of the absolute democraticprinciple; in the eyes of the absolute, outside these two rights, theright of man in the first place, the right of the people in the second,all is usurpation; but what we can say, even at the present day, thatafter making these reserves is, that to sum up the whole, and inwhatever manner he is considered, Louis Philippe, taken in himself, andfrom the point of view of human goodness, will remain, to use theantique language of ancient history, one of the best princes who eversat on a throne
* **Density 6** -> For if they had had another neighborwho was less chimerical and more attentive, any ordinary and charitableman, evidently their indigence would have been noticed, their signalsof distress would have been perceived, and they would have been takenhold of and rescued! They appeared very corrupt and very depraved, nodoubt, very vile, very odious even; but those who fall without becomingdegraded are rare; besides, there is a point where the unfortunate andthe infamous unite and are confounded in a single word, a fatal word,_the miserable_; whose fault is this? And then should not the charitybe all the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great?While reading himself this moral lesson, for there were occasions onwhich Marius, like all truly honest hearts, was his own pedagogue andscolded himself more than he deserved, he stared at the wall whichseparated him from the Jondrettes, as though he were able to make hisgaze, full of pity, penetrate that partition and warm these wretchedpeople
## A Study in Scarlet by Arthur Conan Doyle (6238)
* **Density 3** -> In theexuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, andwe started off together in a hansom
* **Density 6** -> A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that hecomes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him getscrowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so thathe has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it
## The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana by Vatsyayana (6195)
* **Density 2** -> It is only to be presumed that it was written afterthat of Vatsyayana, and previous to the other works on this subject thatare still extant
* **Density 3** -> When a man under some pretext or other goes in front or alongsideof a woman and touches her body with his own, it is called the "touchingembrace
* **Density 5** -> Even byday, and in a place of public resort, when her lover shows her any markthat she may have inflicted on his body, she should smile at the sightof it, and turning her face as if she were going to chide him, sheshould show him with an angry look the marks on her own body that havebeen made by him
* **Density 6** ->     |   +--------+-----------+--------+-----------+In these unequal unions, when the male exceeds the female in point ofsize, his union with a woman who is immediately next to him in size iscalled high union, and is of two kinds; while his union with the womanmost remote from him in size is called the highest union, and is of onekind only
## Emma by Jane Austen (6104)
* **Density 2** -> I took him as he was sleeping onthe sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you wouldwish to see
* **Density 3** -> Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faultsin Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: andthough this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew itwould be so much less so to her father, that she would not have himreally suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect byevery body
* **Density 4** -> they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if hecould, but as his son and daughter’s carriage and horses were actuallyat Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question onthat head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma longto convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room forHarriet also
* **Density 6** -> as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he wasby no means yet reconciled to his own daughter’s marrying, nor couldever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely amatch of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylortoo; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never ableto suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, hewas very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing forherself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if shehad spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield
## Essays of Michel de Montaigne — Complete by Michel de Montaigne (6043)
* **Density 2** -> as the Egyptians after their feasts were wont to present the companywith a great image of death, by one that cried out to them, “Drink and bemerry, for such shalt thou be when thou art dead”; so it is my custom tohave death not only in my imagination, but continually in my mouth
* **Density 4** -> upon what foundation of their justice can the gods take noticeof or reward man after his death and virtuous actions, since it wasthemselves that put them in the way and mind to do them? And why shouldthey be offended at or punish him for wicked ones, since themselves havecreated in him so frail a condition, and when, with one glance of theirwill, they might prevent him from falling? Might not Epicurus, withgreat colour of human reason, object this to Plato, did he not oftensave himself with this sentence: “That it is impossible to establish anything certain of the immortal nature by the mortal?” She does nothingbut err throughout, but especially when she meddles with divine things
* **Density 5** ->     For who ever thought he wanted sense?     Fortune rules in all things     Gentleman would play the fool to make a show of defence     Happen to do anything commendable, I attribute it to fortune     Having too good an opinion of our own worth     He should discern in himself, as well as in others     He who is only a good man that men may know it     How many worthy men have we known to survive their reputation     Humble out of pride     I am very glad to find the way beaten before me by others     I find myself here fettered by the laws of ceremony     I have no mind to die, but I have no objection to be dead     I have not a wit supple enough to evade a sudden question     I have nothing of my own that satisfies my judgment     I would be rich of myself, and not by borrowing     Ill luck is good for something     Imitating other men’s natures, thou layest aside thy own     Immoderate either seeking or evading glory or reputation     Impunity pass with us for justice     It is not for outward show that the soul is to play its part     Knowledge of others, wherein the honour consists     Lessen the just value of things that I possess     License of judgments is a great disturbance to great affairs     Lose what I have a particular care to lock safe up     Loses more by defending his vineyard than if he gave it up
* **Density 6** ->  In this example I find no great miracle, nor doI admit the excuse with which he defends Plutarch, in having added thesewords, “as ‘tis said,” to suspend our belief; for unless it be in thingsreceived by authority, and the reverence to antiquity or religion, hewould never have himself admitted, or enjoined us to believe thingsincredible in themselves; and that these words, “as ‘tis said,” are notput in this place to that effect, is easy to be seen, because heelsewhere relates to us, upon this subject, of the patience of theLacedaemonian children, examples happening in his time, more unlikely toprevail upon our faith; as what Cicero has also testified before him, ashaving, as he says, been upon the spot: that even to their times therewere children found who, in the trial of patience they were put to beforethe altar of Diana, suffered themselves to be there whipped till theblood ran down all over their bodies, not only without crying out, butwithout so much as a groan, and some till they there voluntarily losttheir lives: and that which Plutarch also, amongst a hundred otherwitnesses, relates, that at a sacrifice, a burning coal having falleninto the sleeve of a Lacedaemonian boy, as he was censing, he sufferedhis whole arm to be burned, till the smell of the broiling flesh wasperceived by those present
## Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens (5871)
* **Density 2** -> Apparently satisfied with his inspection, he coughed twice orthrice, and made as many efforts to open a conversation; but the girlheeded him no more than if he had been made of stone
* **Density 3** -> They laughed, and talked of his success indoing this; and Monks, talking on about the boy, and getting very wild,said that though he had got the young devil’s money safely now, he’drather have had it the other way; for, what a game it would have beento have brought down the boast of the father’s will, by driving himthrough every jail in town, and then hauling him up for some capitalfelony which Fagin could easily manage, after having made a good profitof him besides
* **Density 5** -> Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver’s hair over his eyes,and said he’d know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman,observing Oliver’s colour mounting, changed the subject by askingwhether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning?This made him wonder more and more; for it was plain from the repliesof the two boys that they had both been there; and Oliver naturallywondered how they could possibly have found time to be so veryindustrious
* **Density 6** -> Grimwig, who had beenaffecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it witha great crash, and falling back in his chair, discharged from hisfeatures every expression but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulgedin a prolonged and vacant stare; then, as if ashamed of having betrayedso much emotion, he jerked himself, as it were, by a convulsion intohis former attitude, and looking out straight before him emitted a longdeep whistle, which seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air,but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach
## Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen (5871)
* **Density 2** -> could not deny the truth of this, and she tried to find in it amotive sufficient for their silence
* **Density 3** -> Thesedifficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated from Lucy, might notpress very hard upon his patience; but melancholy was the state of theperson by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness,could be felt as a relief!As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession, she weptfor him, more than for herself
* **Density 4** -> Ferrars, as well as notknowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems borrowed all hermoney before she went off to be married, on purpose we suppose to makea show with, and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world; so Iwas very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter,where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs
* **Density 5** -> was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the firstrubber, and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was thereforeat an end, to which both of them submitted without any reluctance, fornothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each otherless than they had done before; and Elinor sat down to the card tablewith the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only withoutaffection for the person who was to be his wife; but that he had noteven the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage, which sincereaffection on _her_ side would have given, for self-interest alone couldinduce a woman to keep a man to an engagement, of which she seemed sothoroughly aware that he was weary
* **Density 6** -> And after thinking it all over and over again, hesaid, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune, and no nothing atall, it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement, becauseit must be for her loss, for he had nothing but two thousand pounds,and no hope of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders, as hehad some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how was theyto live upon that?—He could not bear to think of her doing no better,and so he begged, if she had the least mind for it, to put an end tothe matter directly, and leave him shift for himself
## David Copperfield by Charles Dickens (5848)
* **Density 2** -> I wasstill giddy with the shock of my mother’s death, and in a kind ofstunned state as to all tributary things
* **Density 6** -> So it goes by! I am not about to be hipped again, David; but Itell you, my good fellow, once more, that it would have been well for me(and for more than me) if I had had a steadfast and judicious father!’His face was always full of expression, but I never saw it express sucha dark kind of earnestness as when he said these words, with his glancebent on the fire
* **Density 4** -> think it justifiable, do you, Copperfield, you who pride yourselfso much on your honour and all the rest of it, to sneak about my place,eaves-dropping with my clerk? If it had been ME, I shouldn’t havewondered; for I don’t make myself out a gentleman (though I never wasin the streets either, as you were, according to Micawber), but beingyou!--And you’re not afraid of doing this, either? You don’t think atall of what I shall do, in return; or of getting yourself intotrouble for conspiracy and so forth? Very well
* **Density 5** -> ‘Has there ever been a single minute,waking or sleeping, when it hasn’t been before me, just as it used tobe in the lost days when I turned my back upon it for ever and for ever!Oh, home, home! Oh dear, dear uncle, if you ever could have known theagony your love would cause me when I fell away from good, you neverwould have shown it to me so constant, much as you felt it; but wouldhave been angry to me, at least once in my life, that I might have hadsome comfort! I have none, none, no comfort upon earth, for all of themwere always fond of me!’ She dropped on her face, before the imperiousfigure in the chair, with an imploring effort to clasp the skirt of herdress
## Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe (5721)
* **Density 2** -> The mostI can do is to try and keep out of the way of it
* **Density 3** -> what an untold world there is in one human heart! Who thought, asGeorge walked calmly up and down the deck of the steamer, with his shycompanion at his side, of all that was burning in his bosom? The mightygood that seemed approaching seemed too good, too fair, even to be areality; and he felt a jealous dread, every moment of the day, thatsomething would rise to snatch it from him
* **Density 4** -> Now,if you take into account that all this was to be worked out by a set oflazy, twaddling, shiftless laborers, who had grown up, all their lives,in the absence of every possible motive to learn how to do anything but‘shirk,’ as you Vermonters say, and you’ll see that there mightnaturally be, on his plantation, a great many things that lookedhorrible and distressing to a sensitive child, like me
* **Density 5** -> To have a great gang of seven hundred, whom I could notknow personally, or feel any individual interest in, bought and driven,housed, fed, worked like so many horned cattle, strained up to militaryprecision,—the question of how little of life’s commonest enjoymentswould keep them in working order being a constantly recurringproblem,—the necessity of drivers and overseers,—the ever-necessarywhip, first, last, and only argument,—the whole thing was insufferablydisgusting and loathsome to me; and when I thought of my mother’sestimate of one poor human soul, it became even frightful!“It’s all nonsense to talk to me about slaves _enjoying_ all this! Tothis day, I have no patience with the unutterable trash that some ofyour patronizing Northerners have made up, as in their zeal toapologize for our sins
* **Density 6** -> I am going to tryto save my boy—you will not blame me! God bless and reward you for allyour kindness!”Hastily folding and directing this, she went to a drawer and made up alittle package of clothing for her boy, which she tied with ahandkerchief firmly round her waist; and, so fond is a mother’sremembrance, that, even in the terrors of that hour, she did not forgetto put in the little package one or two of his favorite toys, reservinga gayly painted parrot to amuse him, when she should be called on toawaken him
## Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin by Benjamin Franklin (5823)
* **Density 2** -> Iremember him well, for when I was a boy he came over to my father inBoston, and lived in the house with us some years
* **Density 3** -> scheme of Order gave me the most trouble;[70] and I found that, tho'it might be practicable where a man's business was such as to leavehim the disposition of his time, that of a journeyman printer, forinstance, it was not possible to be exactly observed by a master, whomust mix with the world, and often receive people of business at theirown hours
* **Density 5** -> mention'd, but without effect, the great and unexpected expense Ihad been put to by being detain'd so long at New York, as a reason formy desiring to be presently paid; and on my observing that it was notright I should be put to any further trouble or delay in obtaining themoney I had advanc'd, as I charged no commission for my service, "O,Sir," says he, "you must not think of persuading us that you are nogainer; we understand better those affairs, and know that every oneconcerned in supplying the army finds means, in the doing it, to fillhis own pockets
* **Density 6** -> is as much as I can now recollect of the project, except that Icommunicated it in part to two young men, who adopted it with someenthusiasm; but my then narrow circumstances, and the necessity I wasunder of sticking close to my business, occasioned my postponing thefurther prosecution of it at that time; and my multifariousoccupations, public and private, induc'd me to continue postponing, sothat it has been omitted till I have no longer strength or activityleft sufficient for such an enterprise; though I am still of opinionthat it was a practicable scheme, and might have been very useful, byforming a great number of good citizens; and I was not discourag'd bythe seeming magnitude of the undertaking, as I have always thoughtthat one man of tolerable abilities may work great changes, andaccomplish great affairs among mankind, if he first forms a good plan,and, cutting off all amusements or other employments that would diverthis attention, makes the execution of that same plan his sole studyand business
## Notes from the Underground by Fyodor Dostoyevsky (5587)
* **Density 2** -> I might foam at the mouth, but bring me a doll toplay with, give me a cup of tea with sugar in it, and maybe I should beappeased
* **Density 5** -> Ihave spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whetherother people feel such enjoyment? I will explain; the enjoyment wasjust from the too intense consciousness of one’s own degradation; itwas from feeling oneself that one had reached the last barrier, that itwas horrible, but that it could not be otherwise; that there was noescape for you; that you never could become a different man; that evenif time and faith were still left you to change into somethingdifferent you would most likely not wish to change; or if you did wishto, even then you would do nothing; because perhaps in reality therewas nothing for you to change into
* **Density 6** -> Oh, tell me, who was it firstannounced, who was it first proclaimed, that man only does nasty thingsbecause he does not know his own interests; and that if he wereenlightened, if his eyes were opened to his real normal interests, manwould at once cease to do nasty things, would at once become good andnoble because, being enlightened and understanding his real advantage,he would see his own advantage in the good and nothing else, and we allknow that not one man can, consciously, act against his own interests,consequently, so to say, through necessity, he would begin doing good?Oh, the babe! Oh, the pure, innocent child! Why, in the first place,when in all these thousands of years has there been a time when man hasacted only from his own interest? What is to be done with the millionsof facts that bear witness that men, _consciously_, that is fullyunderstanding their real interests, have left them in the backgroundand have rushed headlong on another path, to meet peril and danger,compelled to this course by nobody and by nothing, but, as it were,simply disliking the beaten track, and have obstinately, wilfully,struck out another difficult, absurd way, seeking it almost in thedarkness
## A Pickle for the Knowing Ones by Timothy Dexter (5509)
* **Density 2** -> In the year 1770 he married, and receiving aconsiderable amount of money with his wife, he was thus put in possessionof a moderate fortune
* **Density 4** -> In thisedition not a stop or a mark was used in any line of his writings, butin the second edition one entire page was filled with stops and marks,with a recommendation from the author to his readers, to use them wherethey were wanted in the work, or in his own language, "to peper andsoolt it as they pleased
* **Density 6** -> yong man that doth most all my Carving his work is much Liked byour grat men I felt founney one day I thort I would ask sade young manwhare he was bone he sade Now whare what is all that Now whare was yourmother over shaderd I says my mother was if I was to gess No I tell inNow town borne o on the water I says you beat me and so wee Lafed andit shuk of the spleane shoue him A Crows Neast he can carve one A finefellow--I shold had all marbel if any bodey could to me the prise so Ihave sent for 8 busts for kings and grat men and 1 Lion & 2 gray houndsI hope to hear in foue Days to all onnest men                                                         TIMOTHY DEXTER
## Pygmalion by Bernard Shaw (5493)
* **Density 6** -> His great ability as a phonetician (he was, I think, the bestof them all at his job) would have entitled him to high officialrecognition, and perhaps enabled him to popularize his subject, but forhis Satanic contempt for all academic dignitaries and persons ingeneral who thought more of Greek than of phonetics
## The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett (5470)
* **Density 2** -> It was not the first motherless lamb he had found and he knewwhat to do with it
* **Density 3** -> Mary looked for it, and yet when she had entered theupper end of the garden she had noticed that the wall did not seem toend with the orchard but to extend beyond it as if it enclosed a placeat the other side
* **Density 4** -> She could see the tops of trees above the wall, andwhen she stood still she saw a bird with a bright red breast sitting onthe topmost branch of one of them, and suddenly he burst into hiswinter song—almost as if he had caught sight of her and was calling toher
* **Density 5** -> He did not understand at all himself—but he remembered thisstrange hour months afterward when he was at Misselthwaite again and hefound out quite by accident that on this very day Colin had cried outas he went into the secret garden:“I am going to live forever and ever and ever!”The singular calmness remained with him the rest of the evening and heslept a new reposeful sleep; but it was not with him very long
* **Density 6** -> she had been friends with Colin she would have run to show him herpresents at once, and they would have looked at the pictures and readsome of the gardening books and perhaps tried playing the games, and hewould have enjoyed himself so much he would never once have thought hewas going to die or have put his hand on his spine to see if there wasa lump coming
## The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 2 by Edgar Allan Poe (5397)
* **Density 2** -> I continued, as was my      wont, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile      _now_ was at the thought of his immolation
* **Density 3** -> I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I had      scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in      this situation, than if we had been upon a dead level; and this,      I suppose, was owing to the speed at which we revolved
* **Density 4** -> (*1)      “There was one startling circumstance which went a great way in      enforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn      them to account, and this was that, at every revolution, we      passed something like a barrel, or else the yard or the mast of a      vessel, while many of these things, which had been on our level      when I first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the whirlpool,      were now high up above us, and seemed to have moved but little      from their original station
* **Density 5** ->      Hereupon the sister of Scheherazade, as I have it from the      “Isitsöornot,” expressed no very particular intensity of      gratification; but the king, having been sufficiently pinched, at      length ceased snoring, and finally said, “Hum!” and then “Hoo!”      when the queen, understanding these words (which are no doubt      Arabic) to signify that he was all attention, and would do his      best not to snore any more—the queen, I say, having arranged      these matters to her satisfaction, re-entered thus, at once, into      the history of Sinbad the sailor:      “‘At length, in my old age,’ [these are the words of Sinbad      himself, as retailed by Scheherazade]—‘at length, in my old age,      and after enjoying many years of tranquillity at home, I became      once more possessed of a desire of visiting foreign countries;      and one day, without acquainting any of my family with my design,      I packed up some bundles of such merchandise as was most precious      and least bulky, and, engaging a porter to carry them, went with      him down to the sea-shore, to await the arrival of any chance      vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into some region      which I had not as yet explored
* **Density 6** -> Do you know      I think them exceedingly entertaining and strange?”      The king having thus expressed himself, we are told, the fair      Scheherazade resumed her history in the following words:      “Sinbad went on in this manner with his narrative—‘I thanked the      man-animal for its kindness, and soon found myself very much at      home on the beast, which swam at a prodigious rate through the      ocean; although the surface of the latter is, in that part of the      world, by no means flat, but round like a pomegranate, so that we      went—so to say—either up hill or down hill all the time

Did he not, again and again, have to drink from holysources, as a thirsty man, from the offerings, from the books, from thedisputes of the Brahmans? Why did he, the irreproachable one, have towash off sins every day, strive for a cleansing every day, over andover every day? Was not Atman in him, did not the pristine sourcespring from his heart?

For all of these manyyears, without knowing it himself, he had tried hard and longed tobecome a man like those many, like those children, and in all this, hislife had been much more miserable and poorer than theirs, and theirgoals were not his, nor their worries; after all, that entire world ofthe Kamaswami-people had only been a game to him, a dance he wouldwatch, a comedy

Throw thyself about,--outward, backward, thou light one! Sing!speak no more!--Are not all words made for the heavy? Do not all words lie to thelight ones? Sing! speak no more!”--Oh, how could I not be ardent for Eternity, and for the marriage-ring ofrings--the ring of the return?Never yet have I found the woman by whom I should like to have children,unless it be this woman whom I love: for I love thee, O Eternity!FOR I LOVE THEE, O ETERNITY!FOURTH AND LAST PART

With what wistful look did heeye every trembling ray of light streaming across the waste fields fromsome distant window! How often was he appalled by some shrub coveredwith snow, which, like a sheeted spectre, beset his very path! How oftendid he shrink with curdling awe at the sound of his own steps on thefrosty crust beneath his feet; and dread to look over his shoulder, lesthe should behold some uncouth being tramping close behind him! And howoften was he thrown into complete dismay by some rushing blast, howlingamong the trees, in the idea that it was the Galloping Hessian on one ofhis nightly scourings!All these, however, were mere terrors of the night, phantoms of the mindthat walk in darkness; and though he had seen many spectres in his time,and been more than once beset by Satan in divers shapes, in his lonelyperambulations, yet daylight put an end to all these evils; and he wouldhave passed a pleasant life of it, in despite of the Devil and all hisworks, if his path had not been crossed by a being that causes moreperplexity to mortal man than ghosts, goblins, and the whole race ofwitches put together, and that was--a woman
