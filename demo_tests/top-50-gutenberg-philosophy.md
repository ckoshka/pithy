## Politics: A Treatise on Government
* **Density 0.4** ->  The legislator is the only possible teacher of virtue   
* **Density 1.6** ->  It is a city, he admits in the Laws, for gods or the children of gods, not for men as they are   
* **Density 2** ->   There is also another point at which it will still continue to be a city, but it will approach so near to not being one, that it will be worse than none; as if any one should reduce the voices of those who sing in concert to one, or a verse to a foot   
* **Density 5** ->  He then is by nature formed a slave who is qualified to become the chattel of another person, and on that account is so, and who has just reason enough to know that there is such a faculty, without being indued with the use of it; for other animals have no perception of reason, but are entirely guided by appetite, and indeed they vary very little in their use from each other; for the advantage which we receive, both from slaves and tame animals, arises from their bodily strength administering to our necessities; for it is the intention of nature to make the bodies of slaves and freemen different from each other, that the one should be robust for their necessary purposes, the others erect, useless indeed for what slaves are employed in, but fit for civil life, which is divided into the duties of war and peace; though these rules do not always take place, for slaves have sometimes the bodies of freemen, sometimes the souls; if then it is evident that if some bodies are as much more excellent than others as the statues of the gods excel the human form, every one will allow that the inferior ought to be slaves to the superior; and if this is true with respect to the body, it is still juster to determine in the same manner, when we consider the soul; though it is not so easy to perceive the beauty of [1255a] the soul as it is of the body   
## Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic
* **Density 0.1** ->  And here is the third fact to which attention should be drawn   
* **Density 1.2** ->  For, in our eyes, form is always the outline of a movement   
* **Density 3** ->  It seems as though the comic could not produce its disturbing effect unless it fell, so to say, on the surface of a soul that is thoroughly calm and unruffled   
* **Density 5** ->  How often has it been said that the fuller the theatre, the more uncontrolled the laughter of the audience! On the other hand, how often has the remark been made that many comic effects are incapable of translation from one language to another, because they refer to the customs and ideas of a particular social group! It is through not understanding the importance of this double fact that the comic has been looked upon as a mere curiosity in which the mind finds amusement, and laughter itself as a strange, isolated phenomenon, without any bearing on the rest of human activity   
## Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays
* **Density 0.1** ->  This, however, would not go to the root of the matter   
* **Density 0.4** ->  But to speak of _the_ cause is to imply a uniqueness which does not exist   
* **Density 0.8** ->  This degree of submission to Power is not only just and right: it is the very gate of wisdom   
* **Density 1.2** ->  It is this need of generality which has led to the belief that philosophy deals with the universe as a whole   
* **Density 1.6** ->  It is only by inference that the fire is judged to be the cause of the heat which we feel in our body   
* **Density 2** ->   In regard to relations, it might be urged that we are never aware of the universal relation itself, but only of complexes in which it is a constituent   
* **Density 3** ->  In reply to this argument, it should be observed in the first place that the heat of which we are immediately aware is not in the fire but in our own body   
* **Density 4** ->   If, then, when we say that something is in the mind we mean that it has a certain recognisable intrinsic characteristic such as belongs to thoughts and desires, it must be maintained on grounds of immediate inspection that objects of sense are not in any mind   
* **Density 5** ->   I return now to the question, What law or laws can be found to take the place of the supposed law of causality?  First, without passing beyond such uniformities of sequence as are contemplated by the traditional law, we may admit that, if any such sequence has been observed in a great many cases, and has never been found to fail, there is an inductive probability that it will be found to hold in future cases   
## Ion
* **Density 0.4** ->  'No, that is not the real reason; there are many examples to the contrary   
* **Density 1.6** ->  And poetry is a whole; and he who judges of poetry by rules of art ought to be able to judge of all poetry   
* **Density 2** ->  Socrates is of opinion that a man must be mad who behaves in this way at a festival when he is surrounded by his friends and there is nothing to trouble him   
* **Density 3** ->   SOCRATES: Then, my dear friend, can I be mistaken in saying that Ion is equally skilled in Homer and in other poets, since he himself acknowledges that the same person will be a good judge of all those who speak of the same things; and that almost all poets do speak of the same things?  ION: Why then, Socrates, do I lose attention and go to sleep and have absolutely no ideas of the least value, when any one speaks of any other poet; but when Homer is mentioned, I wake up at once and am all attention and have plenty to say?  SOCRATES: The reason, my friend, is obvious   
* **Density 5** ->   SOCRATES: And did you ever know any one who was skilful in pointing out the excellences and defects of Polygnotus the son of Aglaophon, but incapable of criticizing other painters; and when the work of any other painter was produced, went to sleep and was at a loss, and had no ideas; but when he had to give his opinion about Polygnotus, or whoever the painter might be, and about him only, woke up and was attentive and had plenty to say?  ION: No indeed, I have never known such a person   
## Considerations on Representative Government
* **Density 0.1** ->  Take, for instance, the common institution of a police   
* **Density 0.4** ->  He has not the first lesson of political society still to acquire   
* **Density 0.8** ->   It would be out of place to carry the illustration further   
* **Density 1.2** ->  Unless this be the case, which is a question of fact, it is better for them to be completely united   
* **Density 1.6** ->  It can not be denied that the irremovability of any public officer to whom great interests are intrusted is in itself an evil   
* **Density 2** ->  The spirit of vote by ballot--the interpretation likely to be put on it in the mind of an elector, is that the suffrage is given to him for himself--for his particular use and benefit, and not as a trust for the public   
* **Density 3** ->   Those (now happily not a few) who think that justice is as binding on communities as it is on individuals, and that men are not warranted in doing to other countries, for the supposed benefit of their own country, what they would not be justified in doing to other men for their own benefit, feel even this limited amount of constitutional subordination on the part of the colonies to be a violation of principle, and have often occupied themselves in looking out for means by which it may be avoided   
* **Density 4** ->  It is important that he should have the greatest latitude of individual opinion and discretion compatible with the popular control essential to free government; and for this purpose it is necessary that the control should be exercised, as in any case it is best exercised, after sufficient time has been given him to show all the qualities he possesses, and to prove that there is some other way than that of a mere obedient voter and advocate of their opinions, by which he can render himself, in the eyes of his constituents, a desirable and creditable representative   
* **Density 5** ->  And again, if a people have omitted, or from outward pressure have not had it in their power to give themselves a constitution by the tentative process of applying a corrective to each evil as it arose, or as the sufferers gained strength to resist it, this retardation of political progress is no doubt a great disadvantage to them, but it does not prove that what has been found good for others would not have been good also for them, and will not be so still when they think fit to adopt it   
## Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion
* **Density 0.1** ->  The cohesion of the parts of matter is still incomprehensible   
* **Density 0.4** ->  The true system of the heavenly bodies is discovered and ascertained   
* **Density 1.2** ->   Happily, these circumstances are all to be found in the subject of NATURAL RELIGION   
* **Density 1.6** ->  The mind must remain in suspense between them; and it is that very suspense or balance, which is the triumph of scepticism   
* **Density 2** ->   What I chiefly scruple in this subject, said PHILO, is not so much that all religious arguments are by CLEANTHES reduced to experience, as that they appear not to be even the most certain and irrefragable of that inferior kind   
* **Density 4** ->   Might you not say, that all conclusions concerning fact were founded on experience: that when we hear an articulate voice in the dark, and thence infer a man, it is only the resemblance of the effects which leads us to conclude that there is a like resemblance in the cause: but that this extraordinary voice, by its loudness, extent, and flexibility to all languages, bears so little analogy to any human voice, that we have no reason to suppose any analogy in their causes: and consequently, that a rational, wise, coherent speech proceeded, you know not whence, from some accidental whistling of the winds, not from any divine reason or intelligence? You see clearly your own objections in these cavils, and I hope too you see clearly, that they cannot possibly have more force in the one case than in the other   
* **Density 5** ->  But can a conclusion, with any propriety, be transferred from parts to the whole? Does not the great disproportion bar all comparison and inference? From observing the growth of a hair, can we learn any thing concerning the generation of a man? Would the manner of a leaf's blowing, even though perfectly known, afford us any instruction concerning the vegetation of a tree?  But, allowing that we were to take the operations of one part of nature upon another, for the foundation of our judgement concerning the origin of the whole, (which never can be admitted,) yet why select so minute, so weak, so bounded a principle, as the reason and design of animals is found to be upon this planet? What peculiar privilege has this little agitation of the brain which we call thought, that we must thus make it the model of the whole universe? Our partiality in our own favour does indeed present it on all occasions; but sound philosophy ought carefully to guard against so natural an illusion   
## Symbolic Logic
* **Density 1.2** ->  "_all_ of them are _not_-y," which is a Proposition in _A_   
* **Density 1.6** ->  An egg of the Great Auk is not to be had for a song   
* **Density 0.8** ->  The Subject is evidently the Class of persons who are _not_ brave   
* **Density 2** -> , it represents any Member of the Class to which that Adjunct is _peculiar_   
* **Density 5** -> "]      [The Reader is strongly advised, in reading this Chapter, _not_     to refer to the above Diagram, but to draw a large one for     himself, _without any letters_, and to have it by him while he     reads, and keep his finger on that particular _part_ of it,     about which he is reading   
* **Density 4** ->       [The Reader is strongly advised, in reading this Chapter, _not_     to refer to the above Diagrams, but to make a large copy of the     right-hand one for himself, _without any letters_, and to have     it by him while he reads, and keep his finger on that particular     _part_ of it, about which he is reading   
## The Case of Wagner, Nietzsche Contra Wagner, and Selected Aphorisms.
* **Density 0.1** ->   “I am just as much a child of my age as Wagner—_i   
* **Density 0.4** ->  These extracts will be found at the end of “Nietzsche _contra_ Wagner   
* **Density 0.8** ->  It is not malice alone which makes me praise Bizet at the expense of Wagner in this essay   
* **Density 2** ->  In the first period of his relationship with Wagner, he thought that he had found the man who was prepared to lead in this direction   
* **Density 5** ->  Every year thousands are now added to the large party abroad who have ceased from believing in the great musical revolutionary of the seventies; that he was one with the French Romanticists and rebels has long since been acknowledged a fact in select circles, both in France and Germany, and if we still have Wagner with us in England, if we still consider Nietzsche as a heretic, when he declares that “Wagner was a musician for unmusical people,” it is only because we are more removed than we imagine, from all the great movements, intellectual and otherwise, which take place on the Continent   
## Aristotle on the art of poetry
* **Density 0.1** ->  And the _Poetics_ cannot be accounted an exception   
* **Density 0.4** ->  Like most of Aristotle's extant writing, it suggests the MS   
* **Density 0.8** ->  But the New Comedy was in the habit of inventing its plots   
* **Density 1.2** ->  The style, though luminous, vivid, and in its broader division systematic, is not that of a book intended for publication   
* **Density 3** ->  65) that it should be an integral part of the play, which is true; but he also says that it' should be regarded as one of the actors', which shows to what an extent the Chorus in his day was dead and its technique forgotten   
* **Density 5** ->  We have no common name for a mime of Sophron or Xenarchus and a Socratic Conversation; and we should still be without one even if the imitation in the two instances were in trimeters or elegiacs or some other kind of verse--though it is the way with people to tack on 'poet' to the name of a metre, and talk of elegiac-poets and epic-poets, thinking that they call them poets not by reason of the imitative nature of their work, but indiscriminately by reason of the metre they write in   
## Our Knowledge of the External World as a Field for Scientific Method in Philosophy
* **Density 0.1** -> _ there are really to be objects of which one encloses the other   
* **Density 0.4** ->  All the relations that give rise to series are of this kind   
* **Density 0.8** ->  It is difficult to disentangle the truth and the error in this view   
* **Density 1.2** ->  It is a mere accident that we have no memory of the future   
* **Density 1.6** ->  In a sense this is true, and in a sense it is effected in the course of analysis   
* **Density 2** ->   It may, of course, be said that all inferences as to the future are in fact invalid, and I do not see how such a view could be disproved   
* **Density 3** ->   But it is not essential to the existence of a collection, or even to knowledge and reasoning concerning it, that we should be able to pass its terms in review one by one   
* **Density 5** ->  It shows that it is not physical objects, but classes or the general terms by which they are defined, of which numbers can be asserted; and it applies to 0 and 1 without any of the difficulties which other theories find in dealing with these two special cases   
## Aesthetical Essays of Friedrich Schiller
* **Density 0.1** ->  The word man is essential to mark the limits of tragedy   
* **Density 0.4** ->  But it has not the true character of the beautiful   
* **Density 0.8** ->  It is for that reason a person in love desires to find dignity in the object of this passion   
* **Density 1.2** ->  Pathos is a sort of artificial misfortune, and brings us to the spiritual law that commands our soul   
* **Density 1.6** ->  The same object can displease us if we appreciate it in a moral point of view, and be very attractive to us in the aesthetical point of view   
* **Density 2** ->  As, therefore, nature has not only dispensed but cut off the other sex from this task, man must give a double attention to it if he wishes to vie with woman and be equal to her in what is of great interest in human life   
* **Density 3** ->  The pleasure which we take in considering an ideal character will in no way be lessened when we come to think that this character is nothing more than a poetic fiction; for it is on the poetic truth, and not on historic truth, that every aesthetic impression of the feelings rest   
* **Density 4** ->  Who can tell how many luminous ideas, how many heroic resolutions, which would never have been conceived in the dark study of the imprisoned man of science, nor in the saloons where the people of society elbow each other, have been inspired on a sudden during a walk, only by the contact and the generous struggle of the soul with the great spirit of nature? Who knows if it is not owing to a less frequent intercourse with this sublime spirit that we must partially attribute the narrowness of mind so common to the dwellers in towns, always bent under the minutiae which dwarf and wither their soul, whilst the soul of the nomad remains open and free as the firmament beneath which he pitches his tent?  But it is not only the unimaginable or the sublime in quantity, it is also the incomprehensible, that which escapes the understanding and that which troubles it, which can serve to give us an idea of the super-sensuous infinity   
* **Density 5** -> "  How great is the truth and acuteness of this analysis! In what a superior style is this struggle between spirit and the suffering of nature developed! How correctly the author has seized each of the phenomena in which the animal element and the human element manifest themselves, the constraint of nature and the independence of reason! It is well known that Virgil has described this same scene in his "Aeneid," but it did not enter into the plan of the epic poet to pause as the sculptor did, and describe the moral nature of Laocoon; for this recital is in Virgil only an episode; and the object he proposes is sufficiently attained by the simple description of the physical phenomenon, without the necessity on his part of looking into the soul of the unhappy sufferer, as his aim is less to inspire us with pity than to fill us with terror   
## The Game of Logic
* **Density 0.4** -> "  And now what kind of Cakes would you expect to find in compartment No   
* **Density 1.2** -> "  Observe that the letters x, y are written on two of the edges of this compartment   
* **Density 1.6** -> "  There are three 'PROPOSITIONS' for you--the only three kinds we are going to use in this Game:  and the first thing to be done is to learn how to express them on the Board   
* **Density 5** ->   But, if they put it the other way, and ask "Can an Attribute exist without any Thing for it to belong to?", we may say at once "No:  no more than a Baby could go a railway-journey with no one to take care of it!"  You never saw "beautiful" floating about in the air, or littered about on the floor, without any Thing to BE beautiful, now did you?  And now what am I driving at, in all this long rigmarole?  It is this   
## A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge
* **Density 1.2** ->  2], any one of which it indifferently suggests to the mind   
* **Density 1.6** ->  Now, if we will annex a meaning to our words, and speak only of what we can conceive, I believe we shall acknowledge that an idea which, considered in itself, is particular, becomes general by being made to represent or stand for all other particular ideas of the SAME SORT   
* **Density 3** ->  These are in a more especial manner thought to be the object of those sciences which go by the name of LOGIC and METAPHYSICS, and of all that which passes under the notion of the most abstracted and sublime learning, in all which one shall scarce find any question handled in such a manner as does not suppose their existence in the mind, and that it is well acquainted with them   
* **Density 4** ->  And surely it is a work well deserving our pains to make a strict inquiry concerning the First Principles of Human Knowledge, to sift and examine them on all sides, especially since there may be some grounds to suspect that those lets and difficulties, which stay and embarrass the mind in its search after truth, do not spring from any darkness and intricacy in the objects, or natural defect in the understanding, so much as from false Principles which have been insisted on, and might have been avoided   
* **Density 5** -> , that all the choir of heaven and furniture of the earth, in a word all those bodies which compose the mighty frame of the world, have not any subsistence without a mind, that their BEING (ESSE) is to be perceived or known; that consequently so long as they are not actually perceived by me, or do not exist in my mind or that of any other CREATED SPIRIT, they must either have no existence at all, OR ELSE SUBSIST IN THE MIND OF SOME ETERNAL SPIRIT--it being perfectly unintelligible, and involving all the absurdity of abstraction, to attribute to any single part of them an existence independent of a spirit [Note   
## Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 1
* **Density 0.1** ->   Between Christ and other recipients of revelation   
* **Density 0.8** ->   Even this Distinction did not exist in the time of Abraham   
* **Density 1.2** ->   Testimony from the Old Testament itself to the share of the Gentiles in the law and favour of God   
* **Density 1.6** -> " (25) So that the will of God was manifest to him, not in waking, but only in sleep, that is, when the imagination is most active and uncontrolled   
* **Density 3** ->  (24) Matters have long since come to such a pass, that one can only pronounce a man Christian, Turk, Jew, or Heathen, by his general appearance and attire, by his frequenting this or that place of worship, or employing the phraseology of a particular sect - as for manner of life, it is in all cases the same   
* **Density 5** -> ) (33) Further the law of Moses, which might neither be added to nor curtailed, and which was set up as a national standard of right, nowhere prescribed the belief that God is without body, or even without form or figure, but only ordained that the Jews should believe in His existence and worship Him alone: it forbade them to invent or fashion any likeness of the Deity, but this was to insure purity of service; because, never having seen God, they could not by means of images recall the likeness of God, but only the likeness of some created thing which might thus gradually take the place of God as the object of their adoration   
## A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive
* **Density 0.1** ->  Comte’s theory is the negation of this       doctrine   
* **Density 0.4** ->  Whewell’s observation is true of the first alone   
* **Density 0.8** ->  The fact asserted in the definition of a number is a physical fact   
* **Density 1.2** ->  But it must not be supposed that in the employment of the term this or any other rule is always adhered to   
* **Density 1.6** ->  To refer any thing to a class, therefore, is to look upon it as one of the things which are to be called by that common name   
* **Density 2** ->  Turn it in what way we will, this seems to       me to be asserting that a thing is the proof of itself   
* **Density 3** ->  The utmost that the Method of Agreement can do is, to ascertain the whole of the circumstances common to all cases in which a phenomenon is produced; and this aggregate includes not only the cause of the phenomenon, but all phenomena with which it is connected by any derivative uniformity, whether as being collateral effects of the same cause, or effects of any other cause which, in all the instances we have been able to observe, co-existed with it   
* **Density 5** ->  And if any one even chooses to say that the one classification is made by nature, the other by us for our convenience, he will be right; provided he means no more than this: Where a certain apparent difference between things (though perhaps in itself of little moment) answers to we know not what number of other differences, pervading not only their known properties, but properties yet undiscovered, it is not optional but imperative to recognize this difference as the foundation of a specific distinction; while, on the contrary, differences that are merely finite and determinate, like those designated by the words white, black, or red, may be disregarded if the purpose for which the classification is made does not require attention to those particular properties   
## The Categories
* **Density 0.4** ->  For instance, 'man' is predicated of the individual man   
* **Density 1.6** ->  Thus 'man' is predicable of the individual man, and is never present in a subject   
* **Density 2** ->   With regard, on the other hand, to those things which are present in a subject, it is generally the case that neither their name nor their definition is predicable of that in which they are present   
* **Density 5** ->   Again, whether we define them as quantitative or not, they have no contraries: for how can there be a contrary of an attribute which is not to be apprehended in or by itself, but only by reference to something external? Again, if 'great' and 'small' are contraries, it will come about that the same subject can admit contrary qualities at one and the same time, and that things will themselves be contrary to themselves   
## Moral Principles in Education
* **Density 0.4** ->  He is indebted to the Society for permission to use this material   
* **Density 1.2** ->  But it is futile to contract and cramp the ethical responsibility of the school in this way   
* **Density 2** ->  Education is a public business with us, in a sense that the protection and restoration of personal health or legal rights are not   
* **Density 5** ->  In this contention the teachers _in principle_ are in the right; if they are in the wrong, it is not because special periods are not set aside for what after all can only be teaching _about_ morals, but because their own characters, or their school atmosphere and ideals, or their methods of teaching, or the subject-matter which they teach, are not such _in detail_ as to bring intellectual results into vital union with character so that they become working forces in behavior   
## A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive (Vol. 1 of 2)
* **Density 0.1** ->  Those facts are the real premisses of the reasoning   
* **Density 0.4** ->  Whewell’s observation is true of the first alone   
* **Density 0.8** ->  But it is not equivalent to a proof by the direct Method of Difference   
* **Density 1.2** ->  They are causes in that sense alone, in which one physical fact is said to be the cause of another   
* **Density 2** ->  But it must not be supposed that in the employment of the term this or any other rule is always adhered to   
* **Density 3** ->  When we have occasion for a name which shall be capable of denoting whatever exists, as contradistinguished from non-entity or Nothing, there is hardly a word applicable to the purpose which is not also, and even more familiarly, taken in a sense in which it denotes only substances   
* **Density 4** ->  Because among the infinite variety of the phenomena of nature there is one, namely, a particular mode of action of certain nerves, which has for its cause, and as we are now supposing for its efficient cause, a state of our mind; and because this is the only efficient cause of which we are conscious, being the only one of which in the nature of the case we _can_ be conscious, since it is the only one which exists within ourselves; does this justify us in concluding that all other phenomena must have the same kind of efficient cause with that one eminently special, narrow, and peculiarly human or animal, phenomenon? It is true there are cases in which, with acknowledged propriety, we generalize from a single instance to a multitude of instances   
* **Density 5** ->  And if any one even chooses to say that the one classification is made by nature, the other by us for our convenience, he will be right; provided he means no more than this: Where a certain apparent difference between things (although perhaps in itself of little moment) answers to we know not what number of other differences, pervading not only their known properties but properties yet undiscovered, it is not optional but imperative to recognise this difference as the foundation of a specific distinction: while, on the contrary, differences that are merely finite and determinate, like those designated by the words white, black, or red, may be disregarded if the purpose for which the classification is made does not require attention to those particular properties   
## Discours de la méthode (French)
* **Density 0.4** ->  Il étoit à la tête de ses _Essais de philosophie_   
* **Density 0.8** ->  Quand la lettre de Descartes arriva, il y avoit déjà un mois que son père était mort   
* **Density 1.2** ->  Et ce que j'ai remarqué ici de la cire se peut appliquer à toutes les autres choses qui me sont extérieures et qui se rencontrent hors de moi   
* **Density 1.6** ->  Mais je vois bien ce que c'est; mon esprit est un vagabond qui se plaît à m'égarer, et qui ne sauroit encore souffrir qu'on le retienne dans les justes bornes de la vérité   
* **Density 2** ->  Car y a-t-il rien de soi plus clair et plus manifeste que de penser qu'il y a un Dieu, c'est-à-dire un Être souverain et parfait, en l'idée duquel seul l'existence nécessaire ou éternelle est comprise, et par conséquent qui existe? Et quoique, pour bien concevoir cette vérité, j'aie eu besoin d'une grande application d'esprit, toutefois à présent je ne m'en tiens pas seulement aussi assuré que de tout ce qui me semble le plus certain: mais outre cela je remarque que la certitude de toutes les autres choses en dépend si absolument, que sans cette connoissance il est impossible de pouvoir jamais rien savoir parfaitement   
* **Density 3** ->   Or, qu'un athée[1] puisse connoître clairement que les trois angles d'un triangle sont égaux à deux droits, je ne le nie pas; mais je maintiens seulement que la connoissance qu'il en a n'est pas une vraie science, parce que toute connoissance qui peut être rendue douteuse ne doit pas être appelée du nom de science; et puisque l'on suppose que celui-là est un athée, il ne peut pas être certain de n'être point déçu dans les choses qui lui semblent être très évidentes, comme il a déjà été montré ci-devant; et encore que peut-être ce doute ne lui vienne point en la pensée, il lui peut néanmoins venir s'il l'examine, ou s'il lui est proposé par un autre: et jamais il ne sera hors du danger de l'avoir, si premièrement il ne reconnoît un Dieu   
* **Density 4** ->  Et je m'étois ici particulièrement arrêté à faire voir que s'il y avoit de telles machines qui eussent les organes et la figure extérieure d'un singe ou de quelque autre animal sans raison, nous n'aurions aucun moyen pour reconnoître qu'elles ne seraient pas en tout de même nature que ces animaux; au lieu que s'il y en avoit qui eussent la ressemblance de nos corps, et imitassent autant nos actions que moralement il seroit possible, nous aurions toujours deux moyens très certains pour reconnoître qu'elles ne seroient point pour cela de vrais hommes: dont le premier est que jamais elles ne pourroient user de paroles ni d'autres signes en les composant, comme nous faisons pour déclarer aux autres nos pensées: car on peut bien concevoir qu'une machine soit tellement faite qu'elle profère des paroles, et même quelle en profère quelques unes à propos des actions corporelles qui causeront quelque changement en ses organes, comme, si on la touche en quelque endroit, qu'elle demande ce qu'on lui veut dire; si en un autre, qu'elle crie qu'on lui fait mal, et choses semblables; mais non pas qu'elle les arrange diversement pour répondre au sens de tout ce qui se dira en sa présence, ainsi que les hommes les plus hébétés peuvent faire   
* **Density 5** ->  Et je n'ai que faire ici de m'objecter que peut-être cette idée du triangle est venue en mon esprit par l'entremise de mes sens, pour avoir vu quelquefois des corps de figure triangulaire; car je puis former en mon esprit une infinité d'autres figures, dont on ne peut avoir le moindre soupçon que jamais elles me soient tombées sous les sens, et je ne laisse pas toutefois de pouvoir démontrer diverses propriétés touchant leur nature, aussi bien que touchant celle du triangle; lesquelles, certes, doivent être toutes vraies, puisque je les conçois clairement: et partant elles sont quelque chose, et non pas un pur néant; car il est très évident que tout ce qui est vrai est quelque chose, la vérité étant une même chose avec l'être; et j'ai déjà amplement démontré ci-dessus que toutes les choses que je connois clairement et distinctement sont vraies   
## On the Improvement of the Understanding
* **Density 0.8** ->  To compare this result with the nature and power of man   
* **Density 1.2** ->   (3) To sum up the matter in a word, all our actions and thoughts must be directed to this one end   
* **Density 2** ->  (3) Nothing regarded in its own nature can be called perfect or imperfect; especially when we are aware that all things which come to pass, come to pass according to the eternal order and fixed laws of nature   
* **Density 4** ->  (2) For we may gather from what has been said, that a true idea must necessarily first of all exist in us as a natural instrument; and that when this idea is apprehended by the mind, it enables us to understand the difference existing between itself and all other perceptions   
* **Density 5** ->   [37] (1) Again, method must necessarily be concerned with reasoning or understanding--I mean, method is not identical with reasoning in the search for causes, still less is it the comprehension of the causes of things: it is the discernment of a true idea, by distinguishing it from other perceptions, and by investigating its nature, in order that we may so train our mind that it may, by a given standard, comprehend whatsoever is intelligible, by laying down certain rules as aids, and by avoiding useless mental exertion   
## Ontology, or the Theory of Being
* **Density 0.1** -> (204) And the explanation of this is not far to seek   
* **Density 0.4** ->  The union of substance and accident is not a mechanical union   
* **Density 0.8** ->  But the existence of such a growth in the stomach is pathological, _i   
* **Density 1.2** ->  But whatever perfects a nature does so only because and in so far as it is _a realization of the end_ towards which this nature tends   
* **Density 1.6** ->  In other words, we have to bear in mind that the reality of such a being is not pure actuality but a mixture of potential and actual: that it is an _actus non-purus_, or an _actus mixtus_   
* **Density 2** ->  Thus, existence implies the notion of actuality, and is conceived as that by which any thing or essence _is, distinct from nothingness, in the actual order_   
* **Density 4** ->  If, on the other hand, it can be shown that the different aspects which we apprehend in any _datum_ by means of distinct concepts have not, apart from the consideration of the mind, apart from the analytic activity of our own thought, each its own proper reality, but are only distinct mental views of what is objectively one and the same reality, then the distinction must be regarded as logical, not real,—and this even although there may be in the richness and fulness of that one reality comparatively to the limited capacity of our minds, as well as in the very constitution and modes of thought of our minds themselves, a reason or basis for, and an explanation of, the _multiplicity of concepts_ whereby we attain to an understanding of some _one reality_   
* **Density 5** -> (283) If this be so there is in the same     individual a multiplicity of really and actually distinct     substances; each of these, moreover, has its own existence     proportionate to its essence, since the existence of a created     reality is not really distinct from its essence; nor is there any     reason for saying that any of these substances is incomplete; what     we have a right to say is that no one of them separately is a     complete _nature_, that each being an _incomplete nature_ unites     with all the others to form one _complete nature_: inasmuch as no     one of them separately is an adequate intrinsic principle of all     the functions which it can discharge, and is naturally destined to     discharge, by its natural union with the others, whereas there     results from their union a _new fundamental principle_ of a     co-ordinated and harmonized system of operations—in a word, a _new     nature_   
## A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume 1
* **Density 0.1** ->  It is a state of being which is as it were non-being   
* **Density 0.4** -> , which stand in the way of Yoga practice are removed   
* **Density 0.8** -> ]  101  by it one is led to the more advanced states of a saint   
* **Density 1.2** ->  that which has motion is a substance as is seen in the case of an arrow), (2) agreement in absence (e   
* **Density 1.6** ->  Time is defined as that which gives the notion of youth in the young, simultaneity, and quickness   
* **Density 2** ->  All perception as sameness of a thing is due to the presence of this thing in that object [Footnote ref l]   
* **Density 3** ->  And it may not be out of place to mention that such an opposition and duality were found neither in the Upani@sads nor in the Sâ@mkhya system which is regarded by some as pre-Buddhistic   
* **Density 4** ->  We can have no notion of the meaning of existence other than the impression produced on us; this impression is nothing else but the power exerted by things on us, for there is no reason why one should hold that beyond such powers as are associated with the production of impressions or effects there should be some other permanent entity to which the power adhered, and which existed even when the power was not exerted   
* **Density 5** ->  The Buddhist objection against the Sâ@mkhya explanation that the anta@hkara@nas catch reflection from the external world just as a crystal does from the coloured objects that may lie near it, that there were really momentary productions of crystals and no permanent crystal catching different reflections at different times is refuted by Nyâya; for it says that it cannot be said that all creations are momentary, but it can only be agreed to in those cases where momentariness was actually experienced   
## A Guide to Stoicism
* **Density 1.2** ->  The later schools did not add much to the body of philosophy   
* **Density 4** ->  The motive which led him to do so in the first instance may have been merely the influence of a friend or a discourse from some eloquent speaker, but the choice once made was his own choice, and he adhered to it as such   
* **Density 5** ->  In his third book on the Gods he says 'for it is not possible to find any other origin of justice or mode of its generation save that from Zeus and the nature of the universe for anything we have to say about good and evil must needs derive its origin therefrom', and again in his Physical Theses, 'for there is no other or more appropriate way of approaching the subject of good and evil on the virtues or happiness than from the nature of all things and the administration of the universe--for it is to these we must attach the treatment of good and evil inasmuch as there is no better origin to which we can refer them and inasmuch as physical speculation is taken in solely with a view to the distinction between good and evil   
## Proposed Roads to Freedom
* **Density 0.4** ->  Like Hegel, he saw in history the development of an Idea   
* **Density 1.2** ->  It is difficult not to hate those who torture the objects of our love   
* **Density 1.6** ->  Such government as Anarchism can tolerate must be free government, not merely in the sense that it is that of a majority, but in the sense that it is that assented to by all   
* **Density 5** ->  It is rather to be viewed as a translation into abstract terms of the hatred with which Marx regarded the system that coins wealth out of human lives, and it is in this spirit, rather than in that of disinterested analysis, that it has been read by its admirers   
## The Prince
* **Density 0.1** ->  Both parents were members of the old Florentine nobility   
* **Density 0.8** -> , a translation of which is appended to the  present work   
* **Density 1.2** ->  Filippo Casavecchio has seen it; he will be able to tell you what is in it, and of the discourses I have had with him; nevertheless, I am still enriching and polishing it   
* **Density 2** ->  This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has made that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other measures taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled there, would not have been able to keep it   
* **Density 5** ->  And firstly, if it be not entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken collectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from an inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for men change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and this hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein they are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have gone from bad to worse   
## The Republic
* **Density 0.1** ->   Do we admit the existence of opinion?  Undoubtedly   
* **Density 0.4** ->  But all this is reversed in the case of the unjust man   
* **Density 0.8** ->  ‘Still worse and worse! He will be in the midst of his enemies   
* **Density 1.2** ->   May we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook?  We may   
* **Density 1.6** ->   Yes, he said, and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant   
* **Density 2** ->   And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?  True, he said   
* **Density 5** ->   He proceeded: And now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their minds likely to be affected, my dear Socrates,—those of them, I mean, who are quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower, and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life? Probably the youth will say to himself in the words of Pindar—  ‘Can I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower which may be a fortress to me all my days?’  For what men say is that, if I am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none, but the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakeable   
* **Density 4** -> ’  And if a poet writes of the sufferings of Niobe—the subject of the tragedy in which these iambic verses occur—or of the house of Pelops, or of the Trojan war or on any similar theme, either we must not permit him to say that these are the works of God, or if they are of God, he must devise some explanation of them such as we are seeking; he must say that God did what was just and right, and they were the better for being punished; but that those who are punished are miserable, and that God is the author of their misery—the poet is not to be permitted to say; though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they require to be punished, and are benefited by receiving punishment from God; but that God being good is the author of evil to any one is to be strenuously denied, and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or prose by any one whether old or young in any well-ordered commonwealth   
## Second Treatise of Government
* **Density 0.1** ->  It having been shewn in the foregoing discourse,  (<i>1</i>)   
* **Density 1.2** ->  by the law of the land, which is not to be violated   
* **Density 1.6** ->  But though this be a state of liberty, yet it is not a state of licence: though man in that state have an uncontroulable liberty to dispose of his person or possessions, yet he has not liberty to destroy himself, or so much as any creature in his possession, but where some nobler use than its bare preservation calls for it   
* **Density 2** ->  Which being a trespass against the whole species, and the peace and safety of it, provided for by the law of nature, every man upon this score, by the right he hath to preserve mankind in general, may restrain, or where it is necessary, destroy things noxious to them, and so may bring such evil on any one, who hath transgressed that law, as may make him repent the doing of it, and thereby deter him, and by his example others, from doing the like mischief   
* **Density 5** ->  THE state of war is a state of enmity and destruction: and therefore declaring by word or action, not a passionate and hasty, but a sedate settled design upon another man’s life, puts him in a state of war with him against whom he has declared such an intention, and so has exposed his life to the other’s power to be taken away by him, or any one that joins with him in his defence, and espouses his quarrel; it being reasonable and just, I should have a right to destroy that which threatens me with destruction: for, by the fundamental law of nature, man being to be preserved as much as possible, when all cannot be preserved, the safety of the innocent is to be preferred: and one may destroy a man who makes war upon him, or has discovered an enmity to his being, for the same reason that he may kill a wolf or a lion; because such men are not under the ties of the commonlaw of reason, have no other rule, but that of force and violence, and so may be treated as beasts of prey, those dangerous and noxious creatures, that will be sure to destroy him whenever he falls into their power   
## Beyond Good and Evil
* **Density 1.2** ->  Supposing, in effect, that man is not just the "measure of things   
* **Density 2** ->  And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it? For there is risk in raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk   
* **Density 4** ->  MAGNUS)     PREFACE   SUPPOSING that Truth is a woman--what then? Is there not ground for suspecting that all philosophers, in so far as they have been dogmatists, have failed to understand women--that the terrible seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid their addresses to Truth, have been unskilled and unseemly methods for winning a woman? Certainly she has never allowed herself to be won; and at present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien--IF, indeed, it stands at all! For there are scoffers who maintain that it has fallen, that all dogma lies on the ground--nay more, that it is at its last gasp   
* **Density 5** ->  In that they side AGAINST appearance, and speak superciliously of "perspective," in that they rank the credibility of their own bodies about as low as the credibility of the ocular evidence that "the earth stands still," and thus, apparently, allowing with complacency their securest possession to escape (for what does one at present believe in more firmly than in one's body?),--who knows if they are not really trying to win back something which was formerly an even securer possession, something of the old domain of the faith of former times, perhaps the "immortal soul," perhaps "the old God," in short, ideas by which they could live better, that is to say, more vigorously and more joyously, than by "modern ideas"? There is DISTRUST of these modern ideas in this mode of looking at things, a disbelief in all that has been constructed yesterday and today; there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety and scorn, which can no longer endure the BRIC-A-BRAC of ideas of the most varied origin, such as so-called Positivism at present throws on the market; a disgust of the more refined taste at the village-fair motleyness and patchiness of all these reality-philosophasters, in whom there is nothing either new or true, except this motleyness   
## Thus Spake Zarathustra: A Book for All and None
* **Density 0.1** ->  Lo! cat-like doth the moon come along, and dishonestly   
* **Density 0.4** ->  Raving of the reason was likeness to God, and doubt was sin   
* **Density 0.8** ->  Verily, unto such a spirit it is preying, and the work of a beast of prey   
* **Density 1.2** ->   Do I speak of filthy things? That is not the worst thing for me to do   
* **Density 1.6** ->   I love him who loveth his virtue: for virtue is the will to down-going, and an arrow of longing   
* **Density 2** ->   Not as the law of a God do I desire it, not as a human law or a human need do I desire it; it is not to be a guide-post for me to superearths and paradises   
* **Density 3** ->   For that the Superman may not lack his dragon, the superdragon that is worthy of him, there must still much warm sun glow on moist virgin forests!  Out of your wild cats must tigers have evolved, and out of your poison-toads, crocodiles: for the good hunter shall have a good hunt!  And verily, ye good and just! In you there is much to be laughed at, and especially your fear of what hath hitherto been called “the devil!”  So alien are ye in your souls to what is great, that to you the Superman would be FRIGHTFUL in his goodness!  And ye wise and knowing ones, ye would flee from the solar-glow of the wisdom in which the Superman joyfully batheth his nakedness!  Ye highest men who have come within my ken! this is my doubt of you, and my secret laughter: I suspect ye would call my Superman--a devil!  Ah, I became tired of those highest and best ones: from their “height”  did I long to be up, out, and away to the Superman!  A horror came over me when I saw those best ones naked: then there grew for me the pinions to soar away into distant futures   
* **Density 4** ->   If ever I have drunk a full draught of the foaming spice- and confection-bowl in which all things are well mixed:  If ever my hand hath mingled the furthest with the nearest, fire with spirit, joy with sorrow, and the harshest with the kindest:  If I myself am a grain of the saving salt which maketh everything in the confection-bowl mix well:--  --For there is a salt which uniteth good with evil; and even the evilest is worthy, as spicing and as final over-foaming:--  Oh, how could I not be ardent for Eternity, and for the marriage-ring of rings--the ring of the return?  Never yet have I found the woman by whom I should like to have children, unless it be this woman whom I love: for I love thee, O Eternity!  FOR I LOVE THEE, O ETERNITY!  5   
* **Density 5** ->   If I be fond of the sea, and all that is sealike, and fondest of it when it angrily contradicteth me:  If the exploring delight be in me, which impelleth sails to the undiscovered, if the seafarer’s delight be in my delight:  If ever my rejoicing hath called out: “The shore hath vanished,--now hath fallen from me the last chain--  The boundless roareth around me, far away sparkle for me space and time,--well! cheer up! old heart!”--  Oh, how could I not be ardent for Eternity, and for the marriage-ring of rings--the ring of the return?  Never yet have I found the woman by whom I should like to have children, unless it be this woman whom I love: for I love thee, O Eternity!  FOR I LOVE THEE, O ETERNITY!  6   
## The Communist Manifesto
* **Density 0.8** ->   The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns   
* **Density 3** ->   The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world-market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country   
* **Density 5** ->   And here it becomes evident, that the bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in society, and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as an over-riding law   
## The Problems of Philosophy
* **Density 1.2** ->  In this chapter we have to see why this is the case   
* **Density 1.6** ->  It is true that the table always gives us a sensation of hardness, and we feel that it resists pressure   
* **Density 4** ->  He admits that there must be something which continues to exist when we go out of the room or shut our eyes, and that what we call seeing the table does really give us reason for believing in something which persists even when we are not seeing it   
* **Density 5** ->   The principle we are examining may be called the _principle of induction_, and its two parts may be stated as follows:  (a) When a thing of a certain sort A has been found to be associated with a thing of a certain other sort B, and has never been found dissociated from a thing of the sort B, the greater the number of cases in which A and B have been associated, the greater is the probability that they will be associated in a fresh case in which one of them is known to be present;  (b) Under the same circumstances, a sufficient number of cases of association will make the probability of a fresh association nearly a certainty, and will make it approach certainty without limit   
## On Liberty
* **Density 0.1** ->  But to be a critic of doctrine she was hardly qualified   
* **Density 1.2** ->  It is idle to speculate on the possible results of a different treatment   
* **Density 5** ->  Were I but capable of interpreting to the world one-half the great thoughts and noble feelings which are buried in her grave, I should be the medium of a greater benefit to it than is ever likely to arise from anything that I can write, unprompted and unassisted by her all but unrivalled wisdom   
* **Density 4** ->  The steady habit of correcting and completing his own opinion by collating it with those of others, so far from causing doubt and hesitation in carrying it into practice, is the only stable foundation for a just reliance on it: for, being cognisant of all that can, at least obviously, be said against him, and having taken up his position against all gainsayers--knowing that he has sought for objections and difficulties, instead of avoiding them, and has shut out no light which can be thrown upon the subject from any quarter--he has a right to think his judgment better than that of any person, or any multitude, who have not gone through a similar process   
## Democracy and Education: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education
* **Density 0.1** ->  And mind in this sense is the method of social control   
* **Density 0.4** ->  The mind is moved from the monotony of the customary   
* **Density 0.8** ->  If we are asked what is this end, the answer is that of Nature   
* **Density 1.2** ->  Any fact is general if we use it to give meaning to the elements of a new experience   
* **Density 1.6** ->  If they come in at all, it is as a concession to the material needs of the masses   
* **Density 3** ->  This is a state of things that needs to be remedied, but the remedy is not in the use of methods which increase indifference and aversion   
* **Density 4** ->  When a biography is related just as an account of the doings of a man isolated from the conditions that aroused him and to which his activities were a response, we do not have a study of history, for we have no study of social life, which is an affair of individuals in association   
* **Density 5** ->  These words suggest that a person is bound up with the possibilities inhering in objects; that he is accordingly on the lookout for what they are likely to do to him; and that, on the basis of his expectation or foresight, he is eager to act so as to give things one turn rather than another   
## The Poetics of Aristotle
* **Density 0.8** ->  We have evidence of this in the facts of experience   
* **Density 1.2** ->  Tragedy too is claimed by certain Dorians of the Peloponnese   
* **Density 4** ->  Even when a treatise on medicine or natural science is brought out in verse, the name of poet is by custom given to the author; and yet Homer and Empedocles have nothing in common but the metre, so that it would be right to call the one poet, the other physicist rather than poet   
* **Density 5** ->  He caricatured the practice in the very form of his diction, as in the verse: '{Epsilon pi iota chi alpha rho eta nu / epsilon iota delta omicron nu / Mu alpha rho alpha theta omega nu alpha delta epsilon / Beta alpha delta iota zeta omicron nu tau alpha}, or, {omicron upsilon kappa / alpha nu / gamma / epsilon rho alpha mu epsilon nu omicron sigma / tau omicron nu / epsilon kappa epsilon iota nu omicron upsilon /epsilon lambda lambda epsilon beta omicron rho omicron nu}   
## The Critique of Pure Reason
* **Density 0.1** ->  It is, consequently, a mere product of the mind alone   
* **Density 0.4** ->  Time is nothing but the form of our internal intuition   
* **Density 0.8** ->  The condition of the rule is satisfied in some particular case   
* **Density 1.2** ->  But this notion of adding to the possible is absurd   
* **Density 1.6** ->  We may certainly collect from phenomena a law, according to which this or that usually happens, but the element of necessity is not to be found in it   
* **Density 2** ->  Now, since the world, as a phenomenon, cannot be thus limited in itself for a phenomenon is not a thing in itself; it must be possible for us to have a perception of this limitation by a void time and a void space   
* **Density 3** ->  This ideality, like that of space, is not to be proved or illustrated by fallacious analogies with sensations, for this reason—that in such arguments or illustrations, we make the presupposition that the phenomenon, in which such and such predicates inhere, has objective reality, while in this case we can only find such an objective reality as is itself empirical, that is, regards the object as a mere phenomenon   
* **Density 4** ->  But if we consider this empirical datum generally, and inquire, without reference to its accordance with all our senses, whether there can be discovered in it aught which represents an object as a thing in itself (the raindrops of course are not such, for they are, as phenomena, empirical objects), the question of the relation of the representation to the object is transcendental; and not only are the raindrops mere phenomena, but even their circular form, nay, the space itself through which they fall, is nothing in itself, but both are mere modifications or fundamental dispositions of our sensuous intuition, whilst the transcendental object remains for us utterly unknown   
* **Density 5** ->  At the same time, how “I who think” is distinct from the “i” which intuites itself (other modes of intuition being cogitable as at least possible), and yet one and the same with this latter as the same subject; how, therefore, I am able to say: “I, as an intelligence and thinking subject, cognize myself as an object thought, so far as I am, moreover, given to myself in intuition—only, like other phenomena, not as I am in myself, and as considered by the understanding, but merely as I appear”—is a question that has in it neither more nor less difficulty than the question—“How can I be an object to myself?” or this—“How I can be an object of my own intuition and internal perceptions?” But that such must be the fact, if we admit that space is merely a pure form of the phenomena of external sense, can be clearly proved by the consideration that we cannot represent time, which is not an object of external intuition, in any other way than under the image of a line, which we draw in thought, a mode of representation without which we could not cognize the unity of its dimension, and also that we are necessitated to take our determination of periods of time, or of points of time, for all our internal perceptions from the changes which we perceive in outward things   
## Ethics
* **Density 0.1** -> ), in so far as he constitutes the mind of anything   
* **Density 0.4** -> ), in proportion as his own enjoyment of the good is greater   
* **Density 0.8** ->   But pain is bad, in so far as it diminishes or checks the power of action (IV   
* **Density 1.2** -> ); therefore it may be referred to the mind, in so far as the latter is active (III   
* **Density 3** ->   If, therefore, we form a clear and distinct idea of a given emotion, that idea will only be distinguished from the emotion, in so far as it is referred to the mind only, by reason (II   
* **Density 5** -> --An emotion, in so far as it is referred to the mind, can only be controlled or destroyed through an idea of a modification of the body contrary to, and stronger than, that which we are undergoing   
## The Antichrist
* **Density 0.1** ->   The Antichrist: an Attempt at a Criticism of Christianity   
* **Density 0.4** ->  He had been developing them since the days of his beginning   
* **Density 1.2** ->  The world needed a staggering exaggeration to make it see even half of the truth   
* **Density 3** ->  The notion to the contrary is thoroughly democratic; the mob is the most ruthless of tyrants; it is always in a democratic society that heresy and felony tend to be most constantly confused   
* **Density 5** ->  Alas, poor Nietzsche! After all his laborious efforts to prove that he was not a German, but a Pole--even after his heroic readiness, via anti-anti-Semitism, to meet the deduction that, if a Pole, then probably also a Jew!  But under all this alarmed and preposterous tosh there was at least a sound instinct, and that was the instinct which recognized Nietzsche as the most eloquent, pertinacious and effective of all the critics of the philosophy to which the Allies against Germany stood committed, and on the strength of which, at all events in theory, the United States had engaged itself in the war   
## Apology
* **Density 1.6** -> ) But at the same time he shows that he is not one of them   
* **Density 2** ->  He wishes them to know that the divine sign never interrupted him in the course of his defence; the reason of which, as he conjectures, is that the death to which he is going is a good and not an evil   
* **Density 5** ->  There is at this time a Parian philosopher residing in Athens, of whom I have heard; and I came to hear of him in this way:—I came across a man who has spent a world of money on the Sophists, Callias, the son of Hipponicus, and knowing that he had sons, I asked him: “Callias,” I said, “if your two sons were foals or calves, there would be no difficulty in finding some one to put over them; we should hire a trainer of horses, or a farmer probably, who would improve and perfect them in their own proper virtue and excellence; but as they are human beings, whom are you thinking of placing over them? Is there any one who understands human and political virtue? You must have thought about the matter, for you have sons; is there any one?” “There is,” he said   
## An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding
* **Density 0.4** ->    Of a particular Providence and of a future State   XII   
* **Density 1.6** ->  But this surely is a step or progress of the mind, which wants to be explained   
* **Density 2** ->  If you were to ask a man, why he believes any matter of fact, which is absent; for instance, that his friend is in the country, or in France; he would give you a reason; and this reason would be some other fact; as a letter received from him, or the knowledge of his former resolutions and promises   
* **Density 4** ->  Now I ask, whether it be possible for him, from his own imagination, to supply this deficiency, and raise up to himself the idea of that particular shade, though it had never been conveyed to him by his senses? I believe there are few but will be of opinion that he can: and this may serve as a proof that the simple ideas are not always, in every instance, derived from the correspondent impressions; though this instance is so singular, that it is scarcely worth our observing, and does not merit that for it alone we should alter our general maxim   
* **Density 5** ->  A stone or piece of metal raised into the air, and left without any support, immediately falls: but to consider the matter _a priori_, is there anything we discover in this situation which can beget the idea of a downward, rather than an upward, or any other motion, in the stone or metal? And as the first imagination or invention of a particular effect, in all natural operations, is arbitrary, where we consult not experience; so must we also esteem the supposed tie or connexion between the cause and effect, which binds them together, and renders it impossible that any other effect could result from the operation of that cause   
## Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth in the Sciences
* **Density 0.4** ->   I still continued, however, to hold in esteem the studies of the schools   
* **Density 0.8** ->   For to be possessed of a vigorous mind is not enough; the prime requisite is rightly to apply it   
* **Density 1.6** ->   I was thus led to take the liberty of judging of all other men by myself, and of concluding that there was no science in existence that was of such a nature as I had previously been given to believe   
* **Density 3** ->   And in this it is not likely that all are mistaken the conviction is rather to be held as testifying that the power of judging aright and of distinguishing truth from error, which is properly what is called  good sense or reason, is by nature equal in all men; and that the diversity of our opinions, consequently, does not arise from some being endowed with a larger share of reason than others, but solely from this, that we conduct our thoughts along different ways, and do not fix our attention on the same objects   
* **Density 5** ->  For as I had from that time begun to hold my own opinions for nought because I wished to subject them all to examination, I was convinced that I could not do better than follow in the meantime the opinions of the most judicious; and although there are some perhaps among the Persians and Chinese as judicious as among ourselves, expediency seemed to dictate that I should regulate my practice conformably to the opinions of those with whom I should have to live; and it appeared to me that, in order to ascertain the real opinions of such, I ought rather to take cognizance of what they practised than of what they said, not only because, in the corruption of our manners, there are few disposed to speak exactly as they believe, but also because very many are not aware of what it is that they really believe; for, as the act of mind by which a thing is believed is different from that by which we know that we believe it, the one act is often found without the other   
## Euthyphro
* **Density 0.4** ->  In the Euthyphro, Socrates is awaiting his trial for impiety   
* **Density 0.8** ->   Euthyphro replies, that 'Piety is what is dear to the gods, and impiety is what is not dear to them   
* **Density 2** ->   Socrates has a dislike to these tales of mythology, and he fancies that this dislike of his may be the reason why he is charged with impiety   
* **Density 5** ->  If all the circumstances of the case are considered, are you able to show that your father was guilty of murder, or that all the gods are agreed in approving of our prosecution of him? And must you not allow that what is hated by one god may be liked by another? Waiving this last, however, Socrates proposes to amend the definition, and say that 'what all the gods love is pious, and what they all hate is impious   
## Utilitarianism
* **Density 0.1** ->  The other party to the comparison knows both sides   
* **Density 1.6** ->  It is evident that this cannot be proof in the ordinary and popular meaning of the term   
* **Density 3** ->  If one of the two is, by those who are competently acquainted with both, placed so far above the other that they prefer it, even though knowing it to be attended with a greater amount of discontent, and would not resign it for any quantity of the other pleasure which their nature is capable of, we are justified in ascribing to the preferred enjoyment a superiority in quality, so far outweighing quantity as to render it, in comparison, of small account   
* **Density 5** ->  But this something, what is it, unless the happiness of others, or some of the requisites of happiness? It is noble to be capable of resigning entirely one's own portion of happiness, or chances of it: but, after all, this self-sacrifice must be for some end; it is not its own end; and if we are told that its end is not happiness, but virtue, which is better than happiness, I ask, would the sacrifice be made if the hero or martyr did not believe that it would earn for others immunity from similar sacrifices? Would it be made, if he thought that his renunciation of happiness for himself would produce no fruit for any of his fellow creatures, but to make their lot like his, and place them also in the condition of persons who have renounced happiness? All honour to those who can abnegate for themselves the personal enjoyment of life, when by such renunciation they contribute worthily to increase the amount of happiness in the world; but he who does it, or professes to do it, for any other purpose, is no more deserving of admiration than the ascetic mounted on his pillar   
## The Ethics of Aristotle
* **Density 0.1** ->  Well, this is our acceptation of the term Prodigality   
* **Density 0.4** ->  I desire praise of men this then is the beginning of Resolve   
* **Density 0.8** ->  But it is plain that it is our duty in all things to imitate the highest character   
* **Density 1.2** ->  The most important is that of Justice or the Just Man, to which we may later return   
* **Density 1.6** ->   Let this then be taken for a rough sketch of the Chief Good: since it is probably the right way to give first the outline, and fill it in afterwards   
* **Density 2** ->  So that if there is some one End of all things which are and may be done, this must be the Good proposed by doing, or if more than one, then these   
* **Density 3** ->   But suppose a man takes up another as being a good man, who turns out, and is found by him, to be a scoundrel, is he bound still to entertain Friendship for him? or may we not say at once it is impossible? since it is not everything which is the object-matter of Friendship, but only that which is good; and so there is no obligation to be a bad man’s friend, nor, in fact, ought one to be such: for one ought not to be a lover of evil, nor to be assimilated to what is base; which would be implied, because we have said before, like is friendly to like   
* **Density 4** ->  And so we should say that man is more entirely given up to his passions who pursues excessive pleasures, and avoids moderate pains, being either not at all, or at least but little, urged by desire, than the man who does so because his desire is very strong: because we think what would the former be likely to do if he had the additional stimulus of youthful lust and violent pain consequent on the want of those pleasures which we have denominated necessary?  Well then, since of desires and pleasures there are some which are in kind honourable and good (because things pleasant are divisible, as we said before, into such as are naturally objects of choice, such as are naturally objects of avoidance, and such as are in themselves indifferent, money, gain, honour, victory, for instance); in respect of all such and those that are indifferent, men are blamed not merely[11] for being affected by or desiring or liking them, but for exceeding in any way in these feelings   
* **Density 5** -> ”  Of course we fear evils of all kinds: disgrace, for instance, poverty, disease, desolateness, death; but not all these seem to be the object-matter of the Brave man, because there are things which to fear is right and noble, and not to fear is base; disgrace, for example, since he who fears this is a good man and has a sense of honour, and he who does not fear it is shameless (though there are those who call him Brave by analogy, because he somewhat resembles the Brave man who agrees with him in being free from fear); but poverty, perhaps, or disease, and in fact whatever does not proceed from viciousness, nor is attributable to his own fault, a man ought not to fear: still, being fearless in respect of these would not constitute a man Brave in the proper sense of the term   
## A Treatise of Human Nature
* **Density 0.1** ->  For he shall find, that the affair is of no great importance   
* **Density 0.4** ->  the universe of thought, or my impressions and ideas   
* **Density 0.8** ->   This observation may be extended to justice, and the other virtues of that kind   
* **Density 1.2** ->   Add to this, that pity depends, in a great measure, on the contiguity, and even sight of the object; which is a proof, that it is derived from the imagination   
* **Density 1.6** ->   When I view this table and that chimney, nothing is present to me but particular perceptions, which are of a like nature with all the other perceptions   
* **Density 2** ->  Every different object appears to them entirely distinct and separate; and they perceive, that it is not from a view of the nature and qualities of objects we infer one from another, but only when in several instances we observe them to have been constantly conjoined   
* **Density 3** ->  What we have found once to follow from any object, we conclude will for ever follow from it; and if this maxim be not always built upon as certain, it is not for want of a sufficient number of experiments, but because we frequently meet with instances to the contrary; which leads us to the second species of probability, where there is a contrariety in our experience and observation   
* **Density 4** ->  For we may observe, that there is a continual succession of perceptions in our mind; so that the idea of time being for ever present with us; when we consider a stedfast object at five-a-clock, and regard the same at six; we are apt to apply to it that idea in the same manner as if every moment were distinguished by a different position, or an alteration of the object   
* **Density 5** ->  The argument, which we found on any matter of fact we remember, is more or less convincing according as the fact is recent or remote; and though the difference in these degrees of evidence be not received by philosophy as solid and legitimate; because in that case an argument must have a different force to day, from what it shall have a month hence; yet notwithstanding the opposition of philosophy, it is certain, this circumstance has a considerable influence on the understanding, and secretly changes the authority of the same argument, according to the different times, in which it is proposed to us   
## Theaetetus
* **Density 0.1** ->  that the philosopher may talk and write as he pleases   
* **Density 2** ->  At the time of his own death he is supposed to be a full-grown man   
* **Density 5** ->  But I should like to know, Socrates, whether you mean to say that all this is untrue?'  'First reminding you that I am not the bag which contains the arguments, but that I extract them from Theaetetus, shall I tell you what amazes me in your friend Protagoras?'  'What may that be?'  'I like his doctrine that what appears is; but I wonder that he did not begin his great work on Truth with a declaration that a pig, or a dog-faced baboon, or any other monster which has sensation, is a measure of all things; then, while we were reverencing him as a god, he might have produced a magnificent effect by expounding to us that he was no wiser than a tadpole   
## Also sprach Zarathustra: Ein Buch für Alle und Keinen (German)
* **Density 0.1** ->  Schweigsam schreitet es und unverändert durch die Jahre   
* **Density 0.4** ->  Altes will der Gute, und dass Altes erhalten bleibe   
* **Density 0.8** ->   Noch lernte er das Lachen nicht und die Schönheit   
* **Density 1.2** ->   Zu lange sehnte ich mich und schaute in die Ferne   
* **Density 1.6** ->  Und siehe, dabei kam er unversehens auch an das Stadtthor der _grossen Stadt_: hier aber sprang ein schäumender Narr mit ausgebreiteten Händen auf ihn zu und trat ihm in den Weg   
* **Density 2** ->   Aber den Schafen bin ich’s nicht mehr: so will es mein Loos—gesegnet sei es!  Denn diess ist die Wahrheit: ausgezogen bin ich aus dem Hause der Gelehrten: und die Thür habe ich noch hinter mir zugeworfen   
* **Density 4** ->   Wenn ich je vollen Zuges trank aus jenem schäumenden Würz- und Mischkruge, in dem alle Dinge gut gemischt sind:  Wenn meine Hand je Fernstes zum Nächsten goss und Feuer zu Geist und Lust zu Leid und Schlimmstes zum Gütigsten:  Wenn ich selber ein Korn bin von jenem erlösenden Salze, welches macht, dass alle Dinge im Mischkruge gut sich mischen:—  —denn es giebt ein Salz, das Gutes mit Bösem bindet; und auch das Böseste ist zum Würzen würdig und zum letzten Überschäumen:—  Oh wie sollte ich nicht nach der Ewigkeit brünstig sein und nach dem hochzeitlichen Ring der Ringe,—dem Ring de Wiederkunft!  Nie noch fand ich das Weib, von dem ich Kinder mochte, sei denn dieses Weib, das ich lieb: denn ich liebe dich, oh Ewigkeit!  Denn ich liebe dich, oh Ewigkeit!  5   
* **Density 5** ->   Wenn ich dem Meere hold bin und Allem, was Meeres-Art ist, und am holdesten noch, wenn es mir zornig widerspricht:  Wenn jene suchende Lust in mir ist, die nach Unentdecktem die Segel treibt, wenn eine Seefahrer-Lust in meiner Lust ist:  Wenn je mein Frohlocken rief: „die Küste schwand,—nun fiel mir die letzte Kette ab—  —das Grenzenlose braust um mich, weit hinaus glänzt mir Raum und Zeit, wohlan! wohlauf! altes Herz!“—  Oh wie sollte ich nicht nach der Ewigkeit brünstig sein und nach dem hochzeitlichen Ring der Ringe,—dem Ring de Wiederkunft!  Nie noch fand ich das Weib, von dem ich Kinder mochte, sei denn dieses Weib, das ich lieb: denn ich liebe dich, oh Ewigkeit!  Denn ich liebe dich, oh Ewigkeit!  6   
## An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals
* **Density 0.1** ->  Italics in the original book are capitalized in this e-text   
* **Density 0.4** ->  Nor were these the chief advantages of that happy age   
* **Density 1.2** ->  His exalted station, of itself but the more exposes him to danger and tempest   
* **Density 2** ->   But I forget, that it is not my present business to recommend generosity and benevolence, or to paint, in their true colours, all the genuine charms of the social virtues   
* **Density 5** ->  Is it any crime, after a shipwreck, to seize whatever means or instrument of safety one can lay hold of, without regard to former limitations of property? Or if a city besieged were perishing with hunger; can we imagine, that men will see any means of preservation before them, and lose their lives, from a scrupulous regard to what, in other situations, would be the rules of equity and justice? The use and tendency of that virtue is to procure happiness and security, by preserving order in society: but where the society is ready to perish from extreme necessity, no greater evil can be dreaded from violence and injustice; and every man may now provide for himself by all the means, which prudence can dictate, or humanity permit   
## The Analysis of Mind
* **Density 0.1** ->  You may say the hooter is THE cause of their leaving   
* **Density 0.4** ->  It is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge   
* **Density 0.8** ->  It is they that give the continuity of a "person" or a "mind   
* **Density 1.2** ->  It is important to be clear as to the part which does not consist of beliefs   
* **Density 1.6** ->  In this it is supposed to differ from the mind of animals   
* **Density 3** ->  The notion that actions are performed by an agent is liable to the same kind of criticism as the notion that thinking needs a subject or ego, which we rejected in Lecture I   
* **Density 4** ->  And in order to be an appearance of one or more objects, it is only necessary that the occurrence in question should be connected with them by a continuous chain, and should vary when they are varied sufficiently   
* **Density 5** ->  We cannot distinguish, among nearly invariable antecedents, one as THE cause, and the others as merely its concomitants: the attempt to do this depends upon a notion of cause which is derived from will, and will (as we shall see later) is not at all the sort of thing that it is generally supposed to be, nor is there any reason to think that in the physical world there is anything even remotely analogous to what will is supposed to be
